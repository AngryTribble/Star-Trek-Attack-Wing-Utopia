    <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
    In an effort to stop Imperator Shinzon from starting a war with the Federation, Captain Donatra leads a group of Romulan ships to ambush his flagship, the Scimitar. Finding the Scimitar in the Bassen Rift, th ad-hoc Romulan Fleet now moves in for the attack.<br><br>

    <b> Imperator Shinzon: </b>   60 SP using only Romulan cards and exactly 1 ship. Your fleet must include the Scimitar, with Shinzon assigned to it.<br><br>
    <b> Map Setup: </b>   Players determine initiative and setup order as normal. The Romulan High Command Player sets up their fleet(s) within 4" of the N edge of the play area. The Imperator Shinzon Player sets up their fleet(s) wihtin 4" of the S edge of the play area.<br><br>

    Target Lock Tokens may not be used to re-roll attack dice. If used to active a Secondary Weapon, before the attack roll is made, roll 1 attack die.

    Special Components: 1 Planet Token, 6 Mission Tokens <br><br>
    <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
    The Albino, an Orion Syndicate pirate, has been located operating near Secarus IV. Having had personal dealings with this scum, and endured deep personal losses, you immediately set out to exact your revenge. On arriving, you find that other Klingon ships have also arrived. Your House serves the coldest, best revenge in the Empire - so YOU must be the one to kill the Albino to restore your honor, before the other Houses get to him first.<br><br>
    <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
    <b> Albino Player: </b>    50 SP, must include The Albino as your Captain.<br>
    <b> All Klingon Players: </b>   25 SP each. Each Klingon Player must take Koloth, Kor, or Kang as their Captain, and the Klingon Players may not duplicate unique cards amongst themselves (ie, if Player 2 uses Captain Koloth, Players 3 and 4 are prohibited from using that Captain.)<br><br>
    <b> Map Setup: </b>  Place the Planet Token in the center of the play area. Place 6 Mission Tokens on the Planet Token. Each Player begins in a 4" x 8" area placed at one of the corners of the Play Area.<br><br>
    <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
    <b>Four Thousand Throats May Be Cut In One Night By A Running Man:</b>  Remove 1 Mission Token from the Planet Token during each End Phase.<br>
    <b>Pity The Warrior Whose Foes Are All Slain:</b>    Only 1 Klingon Player may win this scenario. Any other Klingon Player loses the game.<br>
    <b>If Winning Is Not Important, Why Keep Score?:</b>   Suggested adjustments to difficulty include changing the number of Mission Tokens that begin the game on the Planet Token, or starting The Albino's Ship within Range 1 of the Planet Token.<br><br>
    <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
    <b>Albino Player Wins:</b>    When the last Mission Token has been removed from the Planet Token, if the Albino Player's Ship is still in play.<br>
    <b>Klingon Player Wins:</b>   The first Klingon Player to destroy the Albino Player's Ship immediately wins the game.<br></font>
