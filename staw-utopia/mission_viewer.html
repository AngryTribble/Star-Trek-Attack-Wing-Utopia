    <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
    The Albino, an Orion Syndicate pirate, has been located operating near Secarus IV. Having had personal dealings with this scum, and endured deep personal losses, you immediately set out to exact your revenge. On arriving, you find that other Klingon ships have also arrived. Your House serves the coldest, best revenge in the Empire - so YOU must be the one to kill the Albino to restore your honor, before the other Houses get to him first.<br><br>
    <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
    <b> Albino Player: </b>    50 SP, must include The Albino as your Captain.<br>
    <b> All Klingon Players: </b>   25 SP each. Each Klingon Player must take Koloth, Kor, or Kang as their Captain, and the Klingon Players may not duplicate unique cards amongst themselves (ie, if Player 2 uses Captain Koloth, Players 3 and 4 are prohibited from using that Captain.)<br><br>
    <b> Map Setup: </b>  Place the Planet Token in the center of the play area. Place 6 Mission Tokens on the Planet Token. Each Player begins in a 4" x 8" area placed at one of the corners of the Play Area.<br><br>
    <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
    <b>Four Thousand Throats May Be Cut In One Night By A Running Man:</b>  Remove 1 Mission Token from the Planet Token during each End Phase.<br>
    <b>Pity The Warrior Whose Foes Are All Slain:</b>    Only 1 Klingon Player may win this scenario. Any other Klingon Player loses the game.<br>
    <b>If Winning Is Not Important, Why Keep Score?:</b>   Suggested adjustments to difficulty include changing the number of Mission Tokens that begin the game on the Planet Token, or starting The Albino's Ship within Range 1 of the Planet Token.<br><br>
    <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
    <b>Albino Player Wins:</b>    When the last Mission Token has been removed from the Planet Token, if the Albino Player's Ship is still in play.<br>
    <b>Klingon Player Wins:</b>   The first Klingon Player to destroy the Albino Player's Ship immediately wins the game.<br></font>

      Captain Benjamin Sisko and the crew of Deep Space Nine are protecting Gul Dukat and the ruling council of Cardassia from the Klingons. Your mission is to capture Deep Space Nine before Federation Reinforcements can arrive. Unfortunately, it seems that Deep Space Nine has been secretly upgraded with improved phasers and shields as well as a stockpile of 5000 torpedoes. Heavy losses are expected, but today is a good day to die.<br><br>
      <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
      <b> Player One: </b>    100 SP, all ships must be <img src="https://angrytribble.github.io//Star-Trek-Attack-Wing-Utopia/staw-utopia/img/stuff/faction_kli.png" alt="ICON" width="25" height="25" style="vertical-align:middle"/> ships with only <img src="https://angrytribble.github.io//Star-Trek-Attack-Wing-Utopia/staw-utopia/img/stuff/faction_kli.png" alt="ICON" width="25" height="25" style="vertical-align:middle"/> cards equipped to them.<br>

      <b> Map Setup: </b>  Place the Space Station Objective Token between Range 1 and Range 2 away from the N edge of the play area, centered between the E and W edges of the play area. Place 8 Mission Tokens and 20 Shield Tokens on the Space Station Objective Token. One player sets up in a 4" x 8" area in the SE corner of the play area, and the other player sets up in a 4" x 8" area in the SW corner of the play area.<br><br>
      <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
      The Space Station Objective Token represents Deep Space Nine and has the following stats: PWV: 5,  AV: 0,  HV: âˆž,  SV: 20<br><br>
      <b>All Ships Gain The Following Actions:</b><br><br>
      <b>Action:</b>If this ship is within Range 1 of Deep Space Nine and all its Shields have been destroyed: Place any number of Captains, Admirals, and/or <img src="https://angrytribble.github.io//Star-Trek-Attack-Wing-Utopia/staw-utopia/img/stuff/effect_crew.png" width="20" height="20" style="vertical-align:baseline"/> Upgrades equipped to this ship beside Deep Space Nine.<br><br>
      <b>Action:</b>If this ship is within Range 1 of Deep Space Nine and all its Shields have been destroyed: Equip any number of Captains, Admirals, and/or <img src="https://angrytribble.github.io//Star-Trek-Attack-Wing-Utopia/staw-utopia/img/stuff/effect_crew.png" width="20" height="20" style="vertical-align:baseline"/> Upgrades beside Deep Space Nine that were equipped to this ship to this ship.<br><br>
      <b>End Phase:</b><br><br>
      1.    Add up the total printed SP of all players' cards beside Deep Space Nine. For each SP above 15, the player with initiative rolls one attack die. If at least 4 <img src="https://angrytribble.github.io//Star-Trek-Attack-Wing-Utopia/staw-utopia/img/stuff/action_battlestations.png" alt="ICON" width="20" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle"/> are rolled, the delegation has been captured.<br>
      2.    Deep Space Nine rolls a separate attack vs. each ship at Range 1 - 2. For added difficulty, increase these attacks to Range 1 - 3. For reduced difficulty, decrease these attacks to Range 1.<br>
      3.    Remove one Mission Token from Deep Space Nine.<br><br>
      <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
      <b>Both Players Win:</b>    If the delegation is captured and there are no cards beside Deep Space Nine before the last Mission Token is removed from Deep Space Nine<br></font>

      <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
      A Federation Admiral has gone too far in trying to secure the aid of new allies in the fight against the Dominion and has violated the ideals of the Federation. When confronted about this, the Admiral attempted to place your crew under arrest. Then your would-be "allies" attacked you directly. It falls to you to defend the honor and ideals of the Federation. <br><br>
      <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
      <b> Federation Player: </b>    50 SP including 1 Federation ship.<br>
      <b> Opposing Player: </b>    60 SP including at least 2 ships.<br><br>
      <b> Map Setup: </b>  Place the Planet Token in the center of the map with 3 Mission Tokens on it. Place the Minefield Token centered between the N and S edges of the play area, centered between the Planet Token and the W side of the play area. Place 6 Mission Tokens on the Minefield Token to represent the Collector. The Opposing Player then places the 6 Objective Tokens face down anywhere in the play area, not overlapping any other token in the play area. Players determine initiative and set up order as normal. The Federation Player sets up their ship in a 4" x 16" area centered on the S edge of the play area. The Opposing Player sets up their ships within 4" of the Planet Token, with each ship entirely closer to the N edge of the play area.<br><br>
      <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
      <b>Briar Patch:</b>   When a ship performs a maneuver with a speed greater than 2, that ship takes 1 damage for every point of speed of that maneuver over 2. This damage occurs immediately, before taking any actions.

      Upgrade for 0 SP and without requiring an Upgrade slot.<br><br>
      <b> Map Setup: </b>  Place the Planet Token centered 8" from the S and W edges of the play area. Place the Minefield Token touching the N and E edges of the play area (this represents the Bajoran Wormhole). Place the Disabled Federation Ship so that its base is entirely within 4" of the Planet Token. Players determine initiative and set up order for their remaining ships as normal. The Federation player sets up their remaining ships with the rear edge of their bases touching the Minefield Token. The Opposing Player sets up so that their ship bases are entirely within 8" of the Planet Token, but are neither within 4" of the Planet Token, nor within 8" of the Disabled Federation Ship.<br><br>
      <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
      <b>Rescue The Captain! Hurry!:</b>    The Disabled Federation Ship cannot move, be placed, take actions, attack, nor be attacked. During the End Phase, if any other Federation ship is within Range 1 of the Disabled Federation Ship, remove the

      Token is present on its Ship Card. <br><br>
      <b>Make Good Your Escape:</b>   If the front edge of a ship's base or a maneuver template touches the Minefield Token during the Activation Phase, that ship escapes to the Alpha Quadrant (remove it from the game).

      <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
      New intelligence given to the Vulcan High Command shows that the Andorians have recovered a Xindi superweapon, and intend to use it against Vulcan. The Hight Command has sent a large Vulcan fleet to make a preemptive strike against Andoria to prevent this outrage from happening. But the Andorians have sent for reinforcements. If the Vulcan forces has not forced an Andorian surrender before the reinforcements arrive, it is only logical to assume the destruction of the strike force - and of Vulcan as well.  <br><br>
      <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
      <b> Vulcan Player: </b>    100 SP using only <img src="https://angrytribble.github.io//Star-Trek-Attack-Wing-Utopia/staw-utopia/img/stuff/faction_vul.png" alt="ICON" width="25" height="25" style="vertical-align:middle"/> cards.

All ships in your fleet must have a hull value of 4 or less.<br><br>
      <b> Map Setup: </b>  Place the Planet Token in the center of the map with the 10 mission tokens on it. Players determine initiative and setup order as normal. The Vulcan Player sets up their fleet within 4" of the N edge of the play area, and the Andorian Player sets up their fleet within 4" of the S edge of the play area.<br><br>
      <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
      <b>Home Field Advantage:</b>    When defending within Range 1 of the Planet Token, all ships in the Andorian Player's fleet modify their Agility value by +1.<br><br>
      <b>Time Is Of The Essence:</b>    At the end of each game round, remove 1 Mission Token from the Planet Token. <br><br>
      Neither player may use a mine upgrade or an upgrade which removes or places their ship from/in the play area.
      <br><br>
      <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
      <b>Vulcan Player:</b>    You win in the End Phase if you have at least 1 ship in the play area and all enemy ships are destroyed. <br>
      <b>Andorian Player:</b>    You win in the End Phase if you have at least 1 ship in the play area, and either: All Mission Tokens have been removed from the Planet Token <b>OR</b> All enemy ships have been destroyed.<br><br>
      <b>Note:</b> To adjust the game's difficulty, use 8 or 12 Mission Tokens.

      <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
      The Dominion fleet seems unstoppable as they attack more and more systems daily. The Federation Alliance has set up a defensive cordon to prevent any more Dominion ships from slipping into Allied territory. But Starfleet has to many commitments for the number of ships available, so the cordon is spread thin. It falls to the battle-tested Nebula-class ships, leading what few hulls are available, to hold the line, and buy time for the Federation Alliance to gear up production for a full-scale war.  <br><br>
      <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
      <b> Player/Team: </b>    130 SP. Your fleet must include the U.S.S. T'Kumbra, with Solok assigned as its Captain.<br>
      <b> Player/Team: </b>    130 SP, minimum of 3 ships.<br><br>
      <b> Map Setup: </b>  The Federation Player/Team sets up their fleet(s) within 8" of the S edge of the play area.<br>
      The Dominion Player/Team sets up their fleet(s) within 4" of the N edge of the play area.<br><br>
      <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
      <b>4-Player Setup:</b>    FEDERATION ALLIANCE TEAM (2 PLAYERS): 130 SP per player. At least on player must include the U.S.S. T'Kumbra, with Solok assigned as its Captain.<br>
      DOMINION TEAM (2 PLAYERS): 130 SP per player, minimum of 3 ships per player.<br><br>
      Players determine initiative and setup order as normal. The Federation Alliance Player/Team sets up their fleet(s) within 8" of the S edge of the play area. The Dominion Player/Team sets up their fleet(s) within 4" of the N edge of the play area.<br><br>
      Neither player may use a mind upgrade or an upgrade which removes or places their ship from/in the play area.
      <br><br>
      <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
      <b>Federation Alliance Player/Team:</b>    You win in the End Phase if you have at least 1 ship in the play area and all remaining Dominion ships are destroyed. <br>
      <b>Dominion Player/Team:</b>    You win immediately if at least half the ships in your fleet(s) rounded up have left the play area through the S edge of the play area.<br><br>
      <b>Note:</b> To adjust the game's difficulty, vary the number of required escaping Dominion ships to 2 or 4. To adjust the 4-player game's difficulty, adjust the number of players per team to 3 vs 1 or 1 vs 3. The solo player in a team game should use the full points and build restrictions of their chosen fleet.
