    <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
    The Albino, an Orion Syndicate pirate, has been located operating near Secarus IV. Having had personal dealings with this scum, and endured deep personal losses, you immediately set out to exact your revenge. On arriving, you find that other Klingon ships have also arrived. Your House serves the coldest, best revenge in the Empire - so YOU must be the one to kill the Albino to restore your honor, before the other Houses get to him first.<br><br>
    <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
    <b> Albino Player: </b>    50 SP, must include The Albino as your Captain.<br>
    <b> All Klingon Players: </b>   25 SP each. Each Klingon Player must take Koloth, Kor, or Kang as their Captain, and the Klingon Players may not duplicate unique cards amongst themselves (ie, if Player 2 uses Captain Koloth, Players 3 and 4 are prohibited from using that Captain.)<br><br>
    <b> Map Setup: </b>  Place the Planet Token in the center of the play area. Place 6 Mission Tokens on the Planet Token. Each Player begins in a 4" x 8" area placed at one of the corners of the Play Area.<br><br>
    <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
    <b>Four Thousand Throats May Be Cut In One Night By A Running Man:</b>  Remove 1 Mission Token from the Planet Token during each End Phase.<br>
    <b>Pity The Warrior Whose Foes Are All Slain:</b>    Only 1 Klingon Player may win this scenario. Any other Klingon Player loses the game.<br>
    <b>If Winning Is Not Important, Why Keep Score?:</b>   Suggested adjustments to difficulty include changing the number of Mission Tokens that begin the game on the Planet Token, or starting The Albino's Ship within Range 1 of the Planet Token.<br><br>
    <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
    <b>Albino Player Wins:</b>    When the last Mission Token has been removed from the Planet Token, if the Albino Player's Ship is still in play.<br>
    <b>Klingon Player Wins:</b>   The first Klingon Player to destroy the Albino Player's Ship immediately wins the game.<br></font>

      <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
      Captain Benjamin Sisko and the crew of Deep Space Nine are protecting Gul Dukat and the ruling council of Cardassia from the Klingons. Your mission is to capture Deep Space Nine before Federation Reinforcements can arrive. Unfortunately, it seems that Deep Space Nine has been secretly upgraded with improved phasers and shields as well as a stockpile of 5000 torpedoes. Heavy losses are expected, but today is a good day to die.<br><br>
      <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
      <b> Player One: </b>    100 SP, all ships must be <img src="https://angrytribble.github.io//Star-Trek-Attack-Wing-Utopia/staw-utopia/img/stuff/faction_kli.png" alt="ICON" width="25" height="25" style="vertical-align:middle"/> ships with only <img src="https://angrytribble.github.io//Star-Trek-Attack-Wing-Utopia/staw-utopia/img/stuff/faction_kli.png" alt="ICON" width="25" height="25" style="vertical-align:middle"/> cards equipped to them.<br>

      <b> Map Setup: </b>  Place the Space Station Objective Token between Range 1 and Range 2 away from the N edge of the play area, centered between the E and W edges of the play area. Place 8 Mission Tokens and 20 Shield Tokens on the Space Station Objective Token. One player sets up in a 4" x 8" area in the SE corner of the play area, and the other player sets up in a 4" x 8" area in the SW corner of the play area.<br><br>
      <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
      The Space Station Objective Token represents Deep Space Nine and has the following stats: PWV: 5,  AV: 0,  HV: âˆž,  SV: 20<br><br>
      <b>All Ships Gain The Following Actions:</b><br><br>
      <b>Action:</b>If this ship is within Range 1 of Deep Space Nine and all its Shields have been destroyed: Place any number of Captains, Admirals, and/or <img src="https://angrytribble.github.io//Star-Trek-Attack-Wing-Utopia/staw-utopia/img/stuff/effect_crew.png" width="20" height="20" style="vertical-align:baseline"/> Upgrades equipped to this ship beside Deep Space Nine.<br><br>

      <b>End Phase:</b><br><br>
      1.    Add up the total printed SP of all players' cards beside Deep Space Nine. For each SP above 15, the player with initiative rolls one attack die. If at least 4 <img src="https://angrytribble.github.io//Star-Trek-Attack-Wing-Utopia/staw-utopia/img/stuff/action_battlestations.png" alt="ICON" width="20" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle"/> are rolled, the delegation has been captured.<br>
      2.    Deep Space Nine rolls a separate attack vs. each ship at Range 1 - 2. For added difficulty, increase these attacks to Range 1 - 3. For reduced difficulty, decrease these attacks to Range 1.<br>
      3.    Remove one Mission Token from Deep Space Nine.<br><br>
      <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>

      <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
      A Federation Admiral has gone too far in trying to secure the aid of new allies in the fight against the Dominion and has violated the ideals of the Federation. When confronted about this, the Admiral attempted to place your crew under arrest. Then your would-be "allies" attacked you directly. It falls to you to defend the honor and ideals of the Federation. <br><br>
      <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
      <b> Federation Player: </b>    50 SP including 1 Federation ship.<br>
      <b> Opposing Player: </b>    60 SP including at least 2 ships.<br><br>
      <b> Map Setup: </b>  Place the Planet Token in the center of the map with 3 Mission Tokens on it. Place the Minefield Token centered between the N and S edges of the play area, centered between the Planet Token and the W side of the play area. Place 6 Mission Tokens on the Minefield Token to represent the Collector. The Opposing Player then places the 6 Objective Tokens face down anywhere in the play area, not overlapping any other token in the play area. Players determine initiative and set up order as normal. The Federation Player sets up their ship in a 4" x 16" area centered on the S edge of the play area. The Opposing Player sets up their ships within 4" of the Planet Token, with each ship entirely closer to the N edge of the play area.<br><br>
      <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
      <b>Briar Patch:</b>   When a ship performs a maneuver with a speed greater than 2, that ship takes 1 damage for every point of speed of that maneuver over 2. This damage occurs immediately, before taking any actions. That ship's player may place an <img src="https://angrytribble.github.io//Star-Trek-Attack-Wing-Utopia/staw-utopia/img/stuff/effect_auxilary.png" width="20" height="20" style="vertical-align:baseline"/> Token beside it to reduce this damage by 1. If applied to the ship's Hull, all damage is converted to <img src="https://angrytribble.github.io//Star-Trek-Attack-Wing-Utopia/staw-utopia/img/stuff/effect_crit.png" width="20" height="20" style="vertical-align:baseline"/>. <br><br>
      <b>Metaphasic Radiation:</b>    All ships may remove 1 <img src="https://angrytribble.github.io//Star-Trek-Attack-Wing-Utopia/staw-utopia/img/stuff/effect_disable.png" width="25" height="20" style="vertical-align:baseline"/> Token or 2 <img src="https://angrytribble.github.io//Star-Trek-Attack-Wing-Utopia/staw-utopia/img/stuff/effect_time_token.png" width="25" height="20" style="vertical-align:baseline"/> Tokens instead of 1 from any 1 <img src="https://angrytribble.github.io//Star-Trek-Attack-Wing-Utopia/staw-utopia/img/stuff/effect_crew.png" width="20" height="20" style="vertical-align:baseline"/> Upgrade, Captain, Admiral, or Elite Talent Upgrade during each End Phase.
      <br><br>
      <b>Metreon Gas Pockets:</b>   If a ship ends its maneuver touching an Objective Token or its maneuver template overlaps an Objective Token, immediately destroy 1 of its Shield Tokens and place an <img src="https://angrytribble.github.io//Star-Trek-Attack-Wing-Utopia/staw-utopia/img/stuff/effect_auxilary.png" width="20" height="20" style="vertical-align:baseline"/> Token beside it before taking any actions.
      <br><br>
      <b>Activating The Collector:</b>    Each End Phase, move 1 Mission Token from the Planet Token to the Minefield Token.
      <br><br>

      <b> Map Setup: </b>  Place the Planet Token centered 8" from the S and W edges of the play area. Place the Minefield Token touching the N and E edges of the play area (this represents the Bajoran Wormhole). Place the Disabled Federation Ship so that its base is entirely within 4" of the Planet Token. Players determine initiative and set up order for their remaining ships as normal.

      <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
      New intelligence given to the Vulcan High Command shows that the Andorians have recovered a Xindi superweapon, and intend to use it against Vulcan. The Hight Command has sent a large Vulcan fleet to make a preemptive strike against Andoria to prevent this outrage from happening. But the Andorians have sent for reinforcements. If the Vulcan forces has not forced an Andorian surrender before the reinforcements arrive, it is only logical to assume the destruction of the strike force - and of Vulcan as well.  <br><br>
      <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
      <b> Vulcan Player: </b>    100 SP using only <img src="https://angrytribble.github.io//Star-Trek-Attack-Wing-Utopia/staw-utopia/img/stuff/faction_vul.png" alt="ICON" width="25" height="25" style="vertical-align:middle"/> cards.

All ships in your fleet must have a hull value of 4 or less.<br><br>
      <b> Map Setup: </b>  Place the Planet Token in the center of the map with the 10 mission tokens on it. Players determine initiative and setup order as normal. The Vulcan Player sets up their fleet within 4" of the N edge of the play area, and the Andorian Player sets up their fleet within 4" of the S edge of the play area.<br><br>
      <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
      <b>Home Field Advantage:</b>    When defending within Range 1 of the Planet Token, all ships in the Andorian Player's fleet modify their Agility value by +1.<br><br>
      <b>Time Is Of The Essence:</b>    At the end of each game round, remove 1 Mission Token from the Planet Token. <br><br>
      Neither player may use a mine upgrade or an upgrade which removes or places their ship from/in the play area.
      <br><br>
      <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
      <b>Vulcan Player:</b>    You win in the End Phase if you have at least 1 ship in the play area and all enemy ships are destroyed. <br>
      <b>Andorian Player:</b>    You win in the End Phase if you have at least 1 ship in the play area, and either: All Mission Tokens have been removed from the Planet Token <b>OR</b> All enemy ships have been destroyed.<br><br>
      <b>Note:</b> To adjust the game's difficulty, use 8 or 12 Mission Tokens.

      <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
      The Dominion fleet seems unstoppable as they attack more and more systems daily. The Federation Alliance has set up a defensive cordon to prevent any more Dominion ships from slipping into Allied territory. But Starfleet has to many commitments for the number of ships available, so the cordon is spread thin. It falls to the battle-tested Nebula-class ships, leading what few hulls are available, to hold the line, and buy time for the Federation Alliance to gear up production for a full-scale war.  <br><br>
      <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
      <b> Player/Team: </b>    130 SP. Your fleet must include the U.S.S. T'Kumbra, with Solok assigned as its Captain.<br>
      <b> Player/Team: </b>    130 SP, minimum of 3 ships.<br><br>
      <b> Map Setup: </b>  The Federation Player/Team sets up their fleet(s) within 8" of the S edge of the play area.<br>
      The Dominion Player/Team sets up their fleet(s) within 4" of the N edge of the play area.<br><br>
      <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
      <b>4-Player Setup:</b>    FEDERATION ALLIANCE TEAM (2 PLAYERS): 130 SP per player. At least on player must include the U.S.S. T'Kumbra, with Solok assigned as its Captain.<br>
      DOMINION TEAM (2 PLAYERS): 130 SP per player, minimum of 3 ships per player.<br><br>
      Players determine initiative and setup order as normal. The Federation Alliance Player/Team sets up their fleet(s) within 8" of the S edge of the play area. The Dominion Player/Team sets up their fleet(s) within 4" of the N edge of the play area.<br><br>
      Neither player may use a mind upgrade or an upgrade which removes or places their ship from/in the play area.
      <br><br>
      <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
      <b>Federation Alliance Player/Team:</b>    You win in the End Phase if you have at least 1 ship in the play area and all remaining Dominion ships are destroyed. <br>
      <b>Dominion Player/Team:</b>    You win immediately if at least half the ships in your fleet(s) rounded up have left the play area through the S edge of the play area.<br><br>
      <b>Note:</b> To adjust the game's difficulty, vary the number of required escaping Dominion ships to 2 or 4. To adjust the 4-player game's difficulty, adjust the number of players per team to 3 vs 1 or 1 vs 3. The solo player in a team game should use the full points and build restrictions of their chosen fleet.

      Special Components: 1 Planet Token, 12 Mission Tokens, 1 Unused Maneuver Dial with White, Green, and Red Maneuvers<br><br>
      <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
      During a period of strained relations with one of its neighbors, the Romulan Empire has been preparing for war. Any incidents along the Neutral Zone between the two powers could lead to a cataclysm. Naturally, now is the time that a contested planet on the boundary line was invited delegations from each side. Tensions are high, and only a small incident will lead to disaster. Behind the scenes, some Romulan hardliners believe that their preparations will give the Empire the upper hand for the "inevitable" conflict.<br><br>
      <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
      <b>Romulan Player:</b> Both players should agree upon an appropriate number of Squadron Points.<br>
      <b>Enemy Player:</b> Both players should agree upon an appropriate number of Squadron Points.<br><br>
      <b> Map Setup: </b>  Place the Planet Token in the center of the play area. Place 6 Mission Tokens in a line extending from the Planet Token to the NW corner of the play area and 6 Mission Tokens in a line extending fromt the Planet Token to the SE corner of the play area. The Romulan Player sets up in a 4" x 8" area in the NE corner of the play area. The Enemy Player sets up in a 4" x 8" area in the SW corner of the play area.<br><br>
      <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
      <b>A Tense Peace:</b> An attack cannot be made at Range 2 - 3 if it would cross the Neutral Zone Boundary (the line of Mission Tokens). When attacking, if the defending ship is on the same side of the Neutral Zone Boundary as its starting area, then that attack is made with -2 attack dice.<br><br>
      <b>Press The Diplomatic Advantage:</b> During each end phase, a Player scores +10 FP if they have more ships within Range 1 of the Planet Token than their opponent, not counting any ships that overlap or are in base contact with the Planet Token. <br><br>
      <b>Hardliners Secret Objectives:</b> At the end of Setup, the Romulan Player selects an unused maneuver dial that has White, Green, and Red Maneuvers. Set the dial to a Maneuver that has a color matching your Secret Objective and place it facedown: <br><br>
      - Green Maneuver (+5 FP): Destroy one or more opposing ships on your side of the Neutral Zone Boundary. <br>
      - White Maneuver (+10 FP): Have one or more of your ships destroyed on your side of the Neutral Zone Boundary. <br>
      - Red Maneuver (+15 FP): Destroy 2 or more opposing ships on the Enemy Player's side of the Neutral Zone Boundary. <br><br>
      At the end of the game, reveal the selected Hardliners Secret Objective and score the corresponding FP, if applicable.
      <br><br>
      <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
      <b>Romulan Player:</b>   You win if you end the game with more FP scored than the Enemy player.<br><br>
      <b>Enemy Player:</b>   You win if you end the game with more FP scored than the Romulan player.

      <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
      Rumors of a new planet harboring dilithium crystals reach the ears of the Federation, as well as the Klingon and Romulan Empires. So rich is the new source that it threatens to provoke open war from the Romulan Empire, and even threatens the Khitomer Accords between the Federation and the Klingon Empire.<br><br>
      Each great power sends its closest ship to the planet to discover if the rumors are true, hoping that open war can be averted, but first each side wants to retrieve dilithium samples for analysis. The first ship to reach the planet, secure the samples, and return to its home will be able to lay claim to the discovery.<br><br>
      <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
      <b>Federation Player:</b> 40 squadron points, including at least one Federation Ship and one <img src="https://angrytribble.github.io//Star-Trek-Attack-Wing-Utopia/staw-utopia/img/stuff/effect_crew.png" width="20" height="25" style="vertical-align:baseline"/> Upgrade. <br>

      <br><br>
      <b> Map Setup: </b>  The ships are set up as in a standard 3-Player Game (see "3-Player Setup Diagram" on Page 7 of the rulebook). Place the Planet Token in the exact center of the play area and place the 12 Mission Tokens on the table outside of the play area.<br><br>
      <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
      Ships moving through, overlapping, or firing through the Planet Token must obey the rules for the Planet Token outlined on page 26 of the rulebook. <br><br>
      Each ship within Range 1 of the Planet Token gains the following two Actions: <br><br>
      <b>ACTION:</b> If your ship is not Cloaked, disable all of your remaining Shields and then disable your Captain and one Crew Upgrade of your choice (place Disabled Upgrade Tokens on these cards.) These two cards are considered to have beamed down onto the planet as your "Away Team" you cannot remove these Disabled Upgrade Tokens without using the Action listed below. <br><br>
      <b>ACTION:</b> If your ships is not Cloaked, disable all of your remaining Shields to remove the Disabled Upgrade Tokens from your Captain and Crew Upgrade. These two cards are now considered on board the ship and are no longer the "Away Team". <br><br>
      While beamed onto the surface of the planet, an Away Team cannot be targeted by any other cards or effects. While the Captain is part of the Away Team, their ship is considered to have a Skill of 1. <br><br>
      During the End Phase, each ship with an Away Team places 1 Mission Token on top of its Captain Card. Once the Away Team beams back aboard the ship, transfer any Mission Tokens from the Captain Card to their Ship Card. <br><br>
      <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
      Any player that possesses at least 3 Mission Tokens on their Ship Card (not their Captain Card) may enter warp by moving through their starting area and off the play area. This player immediately wins the game. <br><br>
      Any ship that leaves the play area without having 3 Mission Tokens on its Ship Card fails the Mission and loses the game. Also, any ship that leaves the play area without going through its starting area loses the game. <br><br>
      Alternatively, a player can complete the Mission by eliminating all opposing sides.

      <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
      The Federation, Klingons, and Romulans are trying to complete a computer program that is contained within secret genetic codes scattered throughout the galaxy. Each Faction races against the other in order to secure the code's knowledge and power, which is no less than the mystery of life itself.<br><br>
      <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
      <b>Federation Player:</b> 40 squadron points, including at least one Federation Ship and one <img src="https://angrytribble.github.io//Star-Trek-Attack-Wing-Utopia/staw-utopia/img/stuff/effect_crew.png" width="20" height="25" style="vertical-align:baseline"/> Upgrade. <br>

      <br><br>
      <b> Map Setup: </b> The ships are set up in one corner of the board. Each ship begins within a 4" x 4" square as its starting area (use Range 1 on the Range Ruler as a way of outlining 4"). The Federation and Klingon starting areas are at the exact center of each side (East and South) and the Romulan ship is in the corner (Southeast). Place 1 Mission Token beside the Romulan ship.<br><br>
      Place 1 Objective Token in each of the corners closest to the Federation and Klingon ships (Southwest and Northeast) and stack 3 Mission Tokens on top of each Objective Token. The Objective Tokens must be placed exactly 8" from both nearby edges.<br><br>
      Place the Planet Token in the corner opposite the Romulan ship (Northwest). Leave exactly 4" between the Planet Token and both nearby edges. <br><br>
      Place all remaining Mission Tokens on the table outside the play area.<br><br>
      <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
      Each Objective Token represents an abstract point in space and does not act as an Obstacle.<br><br>
      Ships moving through, overlapping, or firing through the Planet Token must obey the "Planet Token" rules outlined on page 26 of the rulebook.<br><br>
      <b>Complete The Computer Program</b><br>
      Each ship within Range 1 of an Objective Token gains the following Action: <br><br>
      <b>ACTION:</b> If you are not Cloaked, disable all of your remaining Shields and roll 1 attack die +1 attack die fro each Mission Token beside your ship (see below). If you roll at least 1
      <img src="https://angrytribble.github.io//Star-Trek-Attack-Wing-Utopia/staw-utopia/img/stuff/effect_hit.png" width="20" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle"/> result, you succeed at decrypting one part of the code. If you succeed, remove all Mission Tokens from beside your ship and place 1 Mission Token (from that Objective stack) on top of your Ship Card. If you fail, place a Mission Token <b>from the supply</b> (not from the Objective Token) beside your ship. You may perform this Action once per round, but you cannot attempt to secure more than 1 Mission Token for your Ship Card from the same Objective Token. <br><br>
      Once a Ship Card has acquired 2 Mission Tokens (one from each Objective Token), the ship must travel to the planet to beam down.<br><br>
      Each ship within Range 1 of the Planet Token gains the following Action: <br><br>
      <b>ACTION:</b> If your ship is not Cloaked, disable all of your remaining Shields and then disable your Captain and one Crew Upgrade of your choice (place Disabled Upgrade Tokens on these cards). These two cards are considered to have beamed down onto the planet as your "Away Team". <br><br>
      <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
      The first ship to palce two Mission Tokens on its Ship Card (one from each Objective Token) and then beam its Captain and one Crew Upgrade onto the planet completes the Mission and wins the game. A ship that is destroyed during the same round that its Captain and Crew beam down automatically loses the game. <br><br>

    <b>Federation Player:</b> 40 SP, including one (and only one) Federation ship with a Hull value of 4 or less.<br><br>
    <b> Map Setup: </b>  Place the Planet Toekn directly in the center of the play area. The Xindi Player sets up anywhere in the play area. The Xindi ships cannot be within Range 3 of each other or the Planet Token. The Federation Player sets up anywhere within Range 1 of the Planet Token. Place the 4 Mission Tokens in a stack beside the play area.<br><br>
    <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
    <b>Azati Prime:</b> The Planet Token represents Azati Prime. Treat this as a normal Planet Token.<br><br>
    <b>Negotiate With The Xindi Council:</b> The Mission Tokens represent the time required by the Federation captain to negotiate with the Xindi Council. At the end of each round, during the End Phase, remove from the game 1 Mission Token from the stack beside the play area. When the last Mission Token is removed from the game, the negotiations are concluded, the Xindi ships are recalled and the game ends. <br><br>
    <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
    <b>Xindi Player:</b>   You win if you destroy the Federation ship before your ships are recalled by the Xindi Council (i.e. when there are no more Mission Tokens left in the stack beside the play area).<br><br>
    <b>Federation Player:</b>   You win if your ship is not destroyed before the Xindi ships are recalled. Alternatively, you win if you destroy one of the Xindi ships.

          Special Components: 4 Objective Tokens, 12 Mission Tokens <br><br>
          <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
          You've been sent on a mission to explore a newly discovered and explored sector of space that has signs of intelligent life. As you being exploring and scanning the outer rim of the sector you come upon four spherical objects that are completely smooth. Your scanners don't show anything anomalous about them, but as you approach each of them begins to open slightly. As you get closer you see a red glow appear out of each of them and they begin firing at you. It appears that each of these spheres is actually an automated sentry turret meant to defend this area! As you take evasive maneuvers to avoid any additional damage to your ship an enemy fleet appears. You must not combat the enemy fleet while also fending off the mysterious spheres!<br><br>
          <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
          <b> Both Players: </b>   130 SP per player.<br><br>
          <b> Map Setup: </b>   Each player, starting with the play with Initiative, takes turns placing the objective tokens in the play area, one at a time. Each objective token must be within 12" of the center of the play area and at least 8" from each other and from each starting area.<br><br>
          Afterwards, the players place their ships in their starting areas according to the normal Set-Up rules for two players.<br><br>
          <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
          All objective tokens represent automated sentry turrets equipped with phasers that are considered obstacles and enemy ships.<br><br>
          Each automated sentry turret has advanced hull plating and self-repair capabilities. As such, they are immune to critical effects and automatically reduce all damage dealt to them by 2. When an automated sentry turret sustains damage, use mission tokens to mark damage against them. When an automated sentry turret has three or more mission tokens on it, remove all mission tokens from it and place one time token on it. It is not in self-repair mode and cannot attack, be attacked, or be targeted for the rest of the turn. Remove all time tokens from all automated sentry turrets at the end of the turn.<br><br>
          At the end of each combat phase, each automated sentry turret that is not in self-repair mode attacks the closest ship within range 1 - 3 with 4 attack dice. Fire each automated sentry turret in ascending order based on the Captain Skill of the ship's being targeted. If it cannot be determined which ship is the closest, of those ships treat the ship with the lowest Captain Skill as the closest. If multiple ships have the same Captain Skill, of those ships, the ship whose player has Initiative is considered closest. If multiple ships are owned by the same player and have the same Captain Skill, of those ships the opposing player chooses which ship is the closest. <br><br>
          <b>END OF THE MISSION:</b><br><br>
          The mission ends when: <br><br>
          1. One player is eliminated <br><br>
          2. The time limit is reached <br><br>
          <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
          1. Destroy all your opponent's ships <br><br>
          2. Have more Fleet Points than your opponent for that Battle Round. <br>
            a. If players have the same Fleet Points for that Battle Round, one player rolls five attack dice and the other player rolls five defense dice. The player who rolls the most <img src="https://angrytribble.github.io//Star-Trek-Attack-Wing-Utopia/staw-utopia/img/stuff/action_battlestations.png" width="20" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle"/> results wins.<br><br>
          BONUS<br><br>
          Each time a player causes a turret to go into self-repair mode they earn +10 Fleet Points.<br><br>

          <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
          While carefully traversing the treacherous terrain of the Briar Patch your ships' sensors start picking up reading of powerful energy fluctuations directly in front of your fleet. However, when brought on screen, there's absolutely nothing there. Just as your crew starts to run more in depth diagnostics an enemy fleet appears across from you behind where the sensors indicate the presence of energy fluctuations. You must fend off you enemies, but proceed with caution, the energy fluctuations may be something much more significant than they appear to be! Will you be able to defeat your enemies? Will you be able to traverse the battlefield without being affected by the energy fluctuations? Find out in this exhilarating mission!<br><br>
          <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
          <b> Both Players: </b>   130 SP per player.<br><br>
          No ship may be equipped with a mine upgrade <br>
          <b>(Cloaked Mines, Antimatter Mines, etc.)</b><br><br>
          <b> Map Setup: </b>  Shuffle the objective tokens, and place the first one face down in the center of the play area. Then, starting with the player with Initiative, the players take turns place the other objective tokens face down throughout the play area, such that they are not within range 1 of the starting areas or another objective token.<br><br>
          Afterwards, the players place their ships in their starting areas according to the normal Set-Up rules for two players.<br><br>
          <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
          Each objective token acts as a normal obstacle and represents a different type of cloaked trap that can be dangerous for any ships that end their movement near it. A ship that ends its movement within range 1 of an objective token may perfomr the following action to attempt to scan and disable the trap:<br><br>
          <b>ACTION:</b> Roll a number of defense dice equal to your current Agility Value. If you roll at least 1 <img src="https://angrytribble.github.io//Star-Trek-Attack-Wing-Utopia/staw-utopia/img/stuff/action_evade.png" width="20" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle"/> result, the trap is considered disarmed. Place the objective token on your side of the play area <b>face down</b>. You may peek at this objective token, but you do not have to share the information with the other player. <br><br>
          If the ship fails to disarm the trap, or does not attempt to disarm the trap, and the trap is still on the f ield at the end of the Activation Phase, then the trap goes off. Carefully flip the objective token over so that you may reveal its image, and consult the Trap chart below. Afterwards remove the objective token from the play area.<br><br>
          <b>NOTE:</b> If a ship ends it movement within range 1 of several traps, it can only attempt to disarm one of them. <br><br>
          TRAPS<br><br>
          1. Space Station: Make a 3 Dice Primary Weapon Attack against all ships within range 1.<br><br>
          2. Asteroid Field: All ships within range 1 sustain 2 damage. Defense dice can be rolled against this damage. <br><br>
          3. Derelict Ship: All ships within range 1 - 3 sustain 1 damage. Defense dice cannot be rolled against this damage. <br><br>
          4. Debris: All ships within range 1 sustain 1 damage to their Hull and receive an Auxiliary Power Token. Defense dice cannot be rolled against this damge. <br><br>

          Your fleet arrives at th scene of a massacre of several ships of unknown origin. You've been tasked with recovering anything of interest from the scene in order to bolster your fleet as well as preventing any opposing factions from gathering anything potentially harmful. As you start moving through and scanning the remains of the ships, your sensors detect an approaching enemy fleet. You must recover as many of the resources as possible while fending off your foes and preventing them from doing the same! Will you succed in your venture or will you fail and let your enemies salvage potentially deadly technology to use against you in the future?<br><br>
          <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
          <b> Both Players: </b>   130 SP per player.<br><br>
          All players must use at least one resource and can use a number of resources equal to the number of ships in their fleet. This supersedes the normal rules limiting each fleet to one resource. All resources are paid for and equipped normally but start the game <b>face down</b>. A face down resource cannot be used and cannot be affected until it is discovered during the mission by analyzing one of the abandoned resource caches (see below). <br><br>
          <b> Map Setup: </b>  Place 1 objective token in the center of the play area, and place the other 2 objective tokens 8" from the east and west edges, centered from north to south.<br><br>

          * 24 Mission Tokens
          <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
          Your fleet arrives in an unexplored sector of space to investigate a series of subspace anomalies causing large scale time fluctuations across the quadrant. As you arrive your sensors detect an enemy fleet coming out of warp nearby. You have direct orders to investigate the anomalies to figure out their source, but you cannot simply ignore your most hated enemies while doing so. As you engage in combat and start investigating these anomalies you realize that they are actually tears in space and time which bridge multiple universes! Will you use these anomalies to your advantage to defeat your enemies or will you try and find the source of the anomalies as quickly as possible and leave your enemy behind?<br><br>
          <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
          <b> Both Players: </b>   130 SP per player.<br><br>
          No ship may have an oversized base.<br><br>
          No ship may equip any upgrade that removes a ship from the play area (such as Warp Jump).<br><br>
          No ship may equip any upgrade that changes an enemy ship's maneuver (such as Lure, Thought Maker, or Faked Messages).<br><br>
          <b> Map Setup: </b>  Place one of the Space Station Objective Tokens face up in the center of the play area. Afterwards, shuffle the remaining objective tokens face down and hand two of them to each player (who cannot peek at them). Starting with the player with the Initiative, the players take turns place the tokens face down in the play area such that no token is within range 2 of any edge of the play area or within range 2 of any other token. Once all the tokens have been placed, carefully flip them face up, and then remove the second Space Station Objective Token so that only 4 Objective Tokens remain in the play area (1 Space Station, 1 Asteroid Field, 1 Debris, and 1 Derelict Ship). <br><br>
          Place the Mission Tokens off to one side of the play area. <br><br>
          Afterwards, the players place their ships in their starting areas per the normal Set-Up rules for two players.<br><br>
          <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
          SUBSPACE ANOMALIES<br><br>
          Each objective token represents subspace anomalies.<br><br>
          Each of the subpace anomalies is numbers:<br><br>
          1. Space Station <br><br>
          2. Derelict Ship <br><br>
          3. Asteroid Field <br><br>
          4. Debris <br><br>
          A ship that passes through one of the objective tokens is displaced into another universe. These alternate universes can only be entered by moving each of your individual ships across the objective tokens in ascending order: <br><br>
          Space Station > Derelict Ship > Asteroid Field > Debris <br><br>
          The number of mission tokens on a ship's base (see below) will indicate which universe that ship is currently in. A ship is consirdered to pass through a subspace anomaly when any part of its base or template touch the objective token.<br><br>
          When a ship passes through a subspace anomaly and the number of the objective token (see above) is exaclty one hight than the number of mission tokens on the ship's base, then immediately place one more mission token on the ship's base. If a ship passes through a subspace anomaly prematurely or passes through the same subspace anomaly a second time, there is no effect. <br><br>
          <b><font size="+1">IMPORTANT:</font></b> A ship can only affect another ship if both ships have the same number of mission tokens on their bases. <br><br>
          When an effect that places a token on the board is used (i.e. Cloaked Mines, Antimatter Mines, etc.) place a number of mission tokens on that token equal to the number of mission tokens on the base of the ship that the effect originated from. Only ships that have the same number of mission tokens on their base as the token can be affected by that token. <br><br>
          <b>END OF THE MISSION:</b><br><br>
          The mission ends when: <br><br>
          1. Any ship has four mission tokens at the end of the round. <br><br>
          2. One player is elminiated <br><br>
          3. The time limit is reached <br><br>

          1. Have the most ships with four mission tokens on their bases at the end of the game. <br>
            a. If players have the same number of ships with four missions tokens on their bases, of those tied ships, the player whose ship has the highest Captain Skill wins the mission. If the ships have the same Captain Skill, the player who has Initiative wins the mission. <br><br>

          * The players then set up using the Standard 2-Player Rules (see page 6 of the Full Rules of Play) with the following exceptions: <br><br>
          - Player 1 sets their Racer <i>(see below)</i> in a 4" x 4" area along the E edge of the play area (which starts exactly 12" from the N edge) and all of their other ships in a 4" x 12" area in the NW corner of the play area. <br><br>
          - Player 2 sets their Racer <i>(see below)</i> in a 4" x 4" area along the E edge of the play area (which starts exactly 12" from the S edge) and all of their other ships in a 4" x 12" area in the SW corner of the play area. <br><br>
          * Place 3 Mission Tokens in a stack beside the play area. At the end of each End Phase, remove on Mission Token from the stack.<br><br>
          <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
          RACER<br><br>
          * Each fleet must include 1 ship that is considered to be its "Racer". These ships must have a Hull Value of 3 or less. <br><br>
          * During Set Up, neither players' Racer can be facing directly N nor directly S and must be facing part of the W edge of the play area. <br><br>
          - To determine if a ship is facing the W edge, choose one side of the ship's base. For this purpose, the side of the base extends all the way to the edge of the play area. If the lines goes through the W edge, it is considered to be facing the W edge. <br><br>
          * During the Planning Phase, a Racer cannot choose a maneuver on its Maneuver Dial with a speed greater than 3 until: <br><br>
          1) One or both Racers have crossed the finish line, OR <br><br>
          2) There are no Mission Tokens left in the stack. <br><br>
          CROSSING THE FINISH LINE <br><br>
          The Objective Tokens and the space between the Objective Tokens represent the finish line. These are not Obstacles and are treated only as points in space. <br><br>
          When a ship executes a maneuver in which either the Maneuver Template or the ship's base physically overlaps one of the Objective Tokens or the space between then Objective Tokens, it is considered to have crossed the finish line. <br><br>
          NOTE: If a ship ends up beyond the Objective Tokens, but neither its Maneuver Template nor its base overlapped the finish line, that ship is considered to have not crossed the finish line. <br><br>
          WINNING THE RACE <br><br>
          Only a ship that crosses the finish line can be considered the winner of the race. The winner o the race is determined in one of 2 ways: <br><br>
          1) If one Racer crosses the finish line and the other does not, the ship that crossed the finish line is considered  to be the winner, OR <br><br>
          2) If both Racers cross the finish line in the same round, the Racer that ends its move closer to the W edge of the play area is considered to be the winner. <br><br>
          The winning Racer immediately places an <b>[Evade]</b> Token beside its ship. <br><br>
          AMBUSHING FLEET <br><br>
          Neither player's ships (other than their Racers) can do anything until: <br><br>
          1) Their Racer has crossed the finish line, OR <br><br>
          2) The last Mission Token is removed from the stack. <br><br>
          Once a player's Racer crosses the finish line, that player may use the rest of their ships as normal. <br><br>
          NOTE: It is possible for 1 player to be able to use all of their ships in a round while the other cannot. <br><br>
          THE GAME ENDS WHEN one player is eliminated or the time limit is reached. <br><br>
          <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
          Destroy all of your opponent's ships.<br><br>
          <b>Bonus:</b> At the end of the game, the player that won the race gains +10 Fleet Points. <br><br>

          2 Objective Tokens, 3 Mission Tokens<br><br>
          <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
          An enemy fleet waits to ambush your ship as you complete the end of the third segment of the Antarian Trans-stellar Rally, a race that covers 2.3 billion kilometers through obstacles that include dwarf star clusters and K-class anomalies.<br><br>
          <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
          <b> Both Players: </b>   130 SP per player.<br><br>
          <b> Map Setup: </b><br>
          * Place 1 Objective Token in the play area, centered from E to W so that there is exactly 12" between it and the N edge of the play area.<br><br>
          * Place 1 Objective Token in the play area, centered from E to W so that there is exactly 12" between it and the S edge of the play area. <br><br>
          * The players then set up using the Standard 2-Player Rules (see page 6 of the Full Rules of Play) with the following exceptions: <br><br>
          - Player 1 sets their Racer <i>(see below)</i> in a 4" x 4" area along the E edge of the play area (which starts exactly 12" from the N edge) and all of their other ships in a 4" x 12" area in the NW corner of the play area. <br><br>
          - Player 2 sets their Racer <i>(see below)</i> in a 4" x 4" area along the E edge of the play area (which starts exactly 12" from the S edge) and all of their other ships in a 4" x 12" area in the SW corner of the play area. <br><br>
          * Place 3 Mission Tokens in a stack beside the play area. At the end of each End Phase, remove on Mission Token from the stack.<br><br>
          <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
          RACER<br><br>
          * Each fleet must include 1 ship that is considered to be its "Racer". These ships must have a Hull Value of 3 or less. <br><br>
          * During Set Up, neither players' Racer can be facing directly N nor directly S and must be facing part of the W edge of the play area. <br><br>
          - To determine if a ship is facing the W edge, choose one side of the ship's base. For this purpose, the side of the base extends all the way to the edge of the play area. If the lines goes through the W edge, it is considered to be facing the W edge. <br><br>
          * During the Planning Phase, a Racer cannot choose a maneuver on its Maneuver Dial with a speed greater than 3 until: <br><br>
          1) One or both Racers have crossed the finish line, OR <br><br>
          2) There are no Mission Tokens left in the stack. <br><br>
          CROSSING THE FINISH LINE <br><br>
          The Objective Tokens and the space between the Objective Tokens represent the finish line. These are not Obstacles and are treated only as points in space. <br><br>
          When a ship executes a maneuver in which either the Maneuver Template or the ship's base physically overlaps one of the Objective Tokens or the space between then Objective Tokens, it is considered to have crossed the finish line. <br><br>
          NOTE: If a ship ends up beyond the Objective Tokens, but neither its Maneuver Template nor its base overlapped the finish line, that ship is considered to have not crossed the finish line. <br><br>

          <font size ="+1">Number of Players: 2 <br>
          Special Components:<br><br>
          1 Planet Token, 12 Mission Tokens<br><br>
          <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
          While attempting to obtain new technology from a ship that is in an orbital facility near a gas giant in the Vintaak system, your fleet is set upon by an enemy fleet. As the battle progresses, the Tholian ships in the area begin to form their energy web around your fleets.<br><br>
          Can you evade the Tholian Web and defeat your opponent? <br><br>
          <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
          <b> Both Players: </b>   130 SP per player.<br><br>
          <b> Map Setup: </b><br>
          * Place a Planet Token centered from N to S so that there is exactly 4" between it and the E edge of the play area.<br><br>
          * Place one Mission Token in the NW corner of the play area, so that there is exactly 12" between it and the N edge of the play area and exactly 4" between it and the W edge of the play area. <br><br>
          * Place one Mission Token in the SW corner of the play area, so that there is exactly 12" between it and the S edge of the play area and exactly 4" between it and the W edge of the play area. <br><br>
          * The players then set up using the Standard 2-Player rules <i>(see pg. 6 of the Rules of Play)</i>.<br><br>
          <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
          GAS GIANT<br><br>
          The Planet Token represents the gas giant. Treat this as a regular Planet Token <i>(see pg. 23 of the Rules of Play)</i> with the following exceptions: <br><br>
          * Any ship that executes a maneuver in which the Maneuver Template overlaps the gas giant suffers one damage. <br>
          * Any ship that overlaps the gas giant at the end of its movement must back up along its Maneuver Template as normal and suffers two additional damage. The ship also skips the "Perform Action" step as normal. <br><br>
          THOLIAN SHIPS <br><br>
          The Mission Tokens represent the Tholian ships. These tokens cannot attack or be attacked, cannot move or perform Actions, and cannot be affected in any way. <br><br>
          At the end of each game round, starting with the player whose ship has the highest Captain Skill (resolve ties normally), each player places another Mission Token in the play area with the following restrictions. The new Tokens: <br><br>
          1) Must be placed within Range 1 of another Mission Token that was already in the play area at the start of the round, <br>
          AND <br>
          2) Cannot be placed within Range 1 of any ship or the Planet Token. <br><br>
          THOLIAN WEB <br><br>
          At the end of every Activation Phase, after all ships have moved, check for damage to ships from the Tholian Web. <br><br>
          Place the Range Ruler between two Mission Tokens within Range 3 of each other, measuring the closest distance between them. If the Range Ruler overlaps a ship's base, that ship suffers one damage. <br><br>
          Repeat this process for every set of two Mission Tokens that are within Range 3 of each other. <br><br>
          NOTE: A ship may suffer more than one damage in a round if it lies between multiple sets of Mission Tokens, that are within Range 3 of each other. <br><br>
          <i> For Example: <br><br>
            A ship finds itself amongst three Mission Tokens that are within Range 3 of each other. <br><br>
            The Range Ruler is placed between Mission Token A and Mission Token B. The Range Ruler overlaps the ship's base, so the ship suffers one damage. <br><br>
            The Range Ruler is then placed between Mission Token B and Mission Token C. The Range Ruler overlaps the ship's base, so the ship suffers one additional damage. <br><br>
            The Range Ruler is then placed between Mission Token A and Mission Token C. The Range Ruler does not overlap the ship's base, so the ship does not suffer any additional damage. </i> <br><br>
            THE GAME ENDS WHEN one player is eliminated of the time limit is reached. <br><br>
          <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
          Destroy all of your opponent's ships.<br><br>
          <b>Bonus:</b> At the end of the game, each player receives +10 Fleet Points for each opposing ship that was destroyed by damage from the Tholian Web. <br><br>

          <font size ="+1">Number of Players: 2 <br>
          Special Components:<br><br>
          1 Objective Token <br><br>
          <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
          Your fleet has encounterd a damaged ship from the past that has emerged from a strange temporal rift. While repairing it, you realize that this ship has caused your timeline to be altered and have determined that it must return through the rift to its own time to set things right. As your fleet escourts the damaged ship back to the rift, you are set upon by an enemy fleet.<br><br>
          Will you successfully return the damaged ship to its own  time? Or will the ship be destroyed on route to the rift, leaving you stuck in this alternate timeline? <br><br>
          <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
          <b> Both Players: </b>   130 SP per player.<br><br>
          <b> Map Setup: </b><br>
          * Place an Objective Token centered N to S so that it touches the E edge of the play area.<br><br>
          * The players then set up using the Standard 2-Player rules <i>(see pg. 6 of the Rules of Play)</i> with the following exceptions:<br><br>
          * Player 1 must place his/her damaged ship <i>(see below)</i> in a 4" x 4" area in the NW corner of the play area. Player 1 then sets up the rest of his/her fleet in an 8" x 15" area in the NW corner of the play area. <br><br>
          * Player 2 must place his/her damaged ship <i>(see below)</i> in a 4" x 4" area in the SW corner of the play area. Player 2 then sets up the rest of his/her fleet in an 8" x 15" area in the SW corner of the play area. <br><br>
          <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
          TEMPORAL RIFT <br><br>
          The Objective Token represents the Temporal Rift. When a ship executes a maneuver in which either the Maneuver Template or the ship's base physically overlaps the Objective Token that ship is considered to have entered the rift and is immediately removed from the play area for the rest of the game. <br><br>
          In addition, if a ship extis the play area within Range 1 of the Objective Token, it is also considered to have entered the rift and is immediately removed from the play area for the rest of the game. <br><br>
          DAMAGED SHIPS <br><br>
          One ship in each player's fleet is considered to be the damaged ship that is attempting to enter the temporal rift. Place Critical Hit Tokens beside both of these ships. These tokens cannot be removed for the duration of the game.<br><br>
          The damaged ship: <br><br>
          1) May only have a Hull value of 4 or less. <br><br>
          2) May not execute a maneuver with a speed greater than 3. <br><br>
          3) Must be assigned a Captain and may only be equipped with one Upgrade card with a printed cost of 5 SP or less. NOTE: This Upgrade's ability cannot allow the damaged ship to be removed from the play area or execute an additional maneuver. <br><br>
          4) Begins the game with one damage to its Hull. Take one damage card from the Damage Deck and place it beside the ship's Ship Card. <br><br>
          5) May transfer a number of damage that receives from an attack to a friendly ship that is within Range 1 of the damaged ship equal to the friendly ship's remaining Shields. Any excess damage hits the damaged ship as normal. <br><br>
          TEMPORAL DISPLACEMENT <br><br>
          At the start of the game, during the Gather Forces step, each player must flip 1/2 of the Upgrades assigned to each of his/her ships face down <i>(round up)</i>. These Upgrades cannot be used until that player's damaged ship enters the temporal rift <i>(see above)</i>. This does not apply to an Upgrade assigned to the player's damaged ship. <br><br>
          Once a player's damaged ship enters the rift, immediately flip all of that player's face down cards face up. Those cards are usable immediately. <br><br>
          <i>For Example: Player 1 has the U.S.S. Enterprise-D with the Jadzia Dax Crew Upgrade and a Photon Torpedeo Weapon Upgrade assigned to it face down. That player's damaged ship move before the Enterprise-D and has entered the temporal rift, so both the Jadzia Dax and Photo Torpedo Upgrade cards are flipped face up. When the Enterprise-D moves this turn it may use Jadzia Dax's Action to perform an additional 2 forward or bank maneuver and during the Combat Phase, it may fire the Photon Torpedo Upgrade as normal. </i><br><br>
          In addition, when a player's damaged ship enters the rift, remove all Disabled Upgrade Tokens from on top of all of that Player's Upgrade cards. <br><br>
          NOTE: An Upgrade card that is flipped face up cannot add Upgrade slot(s) to its ship. <br><br>
          THE GAME ENDS WHEN one player is eliminated or the time limit is reached. <br><br>
          <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
          Destroy all of your opponent's ships.<br><br>
          <b>Bonus:</b> At the end of the game, each player whose damaged ship enters the temporal rift gains +10 Fleet Points. <br><br>
          <b>Bonus:</b> At the end of the game, each player gains +10 Fleet Points for destroying their opponent's damaged ship. <br><br>
