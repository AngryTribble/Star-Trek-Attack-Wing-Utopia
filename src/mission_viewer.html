    <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
    The Albino, an Orion Syndicate pirate, has been located operating near Secarus IV. Having had personal dealings with this scum, and endured deep personal losses, you immediately set out to exact your revenge. On arriving, you find that other Klingon ships have also arrived. Your House serves the coldest, best revenge in the Empire - so YOU must be the one to kill the Albino to restore your honor, before the other Houses get to him first.<br><br>
    <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
    <b> Albino Player: </b>    50 SP, must include The Albino as your Captain.<br>
    <b> All Klingon Players: </b>   25 SP each. Each Klingon Player must take Koloth, Kor, or Kang as their Captain, and the Klingon Players may not duplicate unique cards amongst themselves (ie, if Player 2 uses Captain Koloth, Players 3 and 4 are prohibited from using that Captain.)<br><br>
    <b> Map Setup: </b>  Place the Planet Token in the center of the play area. Place 6 Mission Tokens on the Planet Token. Each Player begins in a 4" x 8" area placed at one of the corners of the Play Area.<br><br>

    <b>Four Thousand Throats May Be Cut In One Night By A Running Man:</b>  Remove 1 Mission Token from the Planet Token during each End Phase.<br>
    <b>Pity The Warrior Whose Foes Are All Slain:</b>    Only 1 Klingon Player may win this scenario. Any other Klingon Player loses the game.<br>
    <b>If Winning Is Not Important, Why Keep Score?:</b>   Suggested adjustments to difficulty include changing the number of Mission Tokens that begin the game on the Planet Token, or starting The Albino's Ship within Range 1 of the Planet Token.<br><br>
    <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
    <b>Albino Player Wins:</b>    When the last Mission Token has been removed from the Planet Token, if the Albino Player's Ship is still in play.<br>
    <b>Klingon Player Wins:</b>   The first Klingon Player to destroy the Albino Player's Ship immediately wins the game.<br></font>

      Captain Benjamin Sisko and the crew of Deep Space Nine are protecting Gul Dukat and the ruling council of Cardassia from the Klingons. Your mission is to capture Deep Space Nine before Federation Reinforcements can arrive. Unfortunately, it seems that Deep Space Nine has been secretly upgraded with improved phasers and shields as well as a stockpile of 5000 torpedoes. Heavy losses are expected, but today is a good day to die.<br><br>
      <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
      <b> Player One: </b>    100 SP, all ships must be <img src='img/faction-klingon.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='25' height='25' title='Klingon'> ships with only <img src='img/faction-klingon.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='25' height='25' title='Klingon'> cards equipped to them.<br>

      <b>All Ships Gain The Following Actions:</b><br><br>
      <b>Action:</b>If this ship is within Range 1 of Deep Space Nine and all its Shields have been destroyed: Place any number of Captains, Admirals, and/or <img src='img/stuff/effect_crew.png' style="vertical-align:baseline" width='20' height='20' title='Crew Upgrade'> Upgrades equipped to this ship beside Deep Space Nine.<br><br>
      <b>Action:</b>If this ship is within Range 1 of Deep Space Nine and all its Shields have been destroyed: Equip any number of Captains, Admirals, and/or <img src='img/stuff/effect_crew.png' style="vertical-align:baseline" width='20' height='20' title='Crew Upgrade'> Upgrades beside Deep Space Nine that were equipped to this ship to this ship.<br><br>
      <b>End Phase:</b><br><br>
      1.    Add up the total printed SP of all players' cards beside Deep Space Nine. For each SP above 15, the player with initiative rolls one attack die. If at least 4 <img src='img/stuff/action_battlestations.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Battlestations'> are rolled, the delegation has been captured.<br>
      2.    Deep Space Nine rolls a separate attack vs. each ship at Range 1 - 2. For added difficulty, increase these attacks to Range 1 - 3. For reduced difficulty, decrease these attacks to Range 1.<br>
      3.    Remove one Mission Token from Deep Space Nine.<br><br>
      <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
      <b>Both Players Win:</b>    If the delegation is captured and there are no cards beside Deep Space Nine before the last Mission Token is removed from Deep Space Nine<br></font>

      <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
      A Federation Admiral has gone too far in trying to secure the aid of new allies in the fight against the Dominion and has violated the ideals of the Federation. When confronted about this, the Admiral attempted to place your crew under arrest. Then your would-be "allies" attacked you directly. It falls to you to defend the honor and ideals of the Federation. <br><br>
      <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
      <b> Federation Player: </b>    50 SP including 1 Federation ship.<br>
      <b> Opposing Player: </b>    60 SP including at least 2 ships.<br><br>
      <b> Map Setup: </b>  Place the Planet Token in the center of the map with 3 Mission Tokens on it. Place the Minefield Token centered between the N and S edges of the play area, centered between the Planet Token and the W side of the play area. Place 6 Mission Tokens on the Minefield Token to represent the Collector. The Opposing Player then places the 6 Objective Tokens face down anywhere in the play area, not overlapping any other token in the play area. Players determine initiative and set up order as normal. The Federation Player sets up their ship in a 4" x 16" area centered on the S edge of the play area. The Opposing Player sets up their ships within 4" of the Planet Token, with each ship entirely closer to the N edge of the play area.<br><br>
      <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
      <b>Briar Patch:</b>   When a ship performs a maneuver with a speed greater than 2, that ship takes 1 damage for every point of speed of that maneuver over 2. This damage occurs immediately, before taking any actions. That ship's player may place an <img src='img/stuff/effect_auxilary.png' style="vertical-align:baseline" width='20' height='20' title='AUX Power Token'> Token beside it to reduce this damage by 1. If applied to the ship's Hull, all damage is converted to <img src='img/stuff/effect_crit.png' style="vertical-align:baseline" width='20' height='20' title='Crit Result'>. <br><br>
      <b>Metaphasic Radiation:</b>    All ships may remove 1 <img src='img/stuff/effect_disable.png' style="vertical-align:baseline" width='25' height='20' title='Disabled Token'> Token or 2 <img src='img/stuff/effect_time_token.png' style="vertical-align:baseline" width='25' height='20' title='Time Token'> Tokens instead of 1 from any 1 <img src='img/stuff/effect_crew.png' style="vertical-align:baseline" width='20' height='20' title='Crew Upgrade'> Upgrade, Captain, Admiral, or Elite Talent Upgrade during each End Phase.
      <br><br>
      <b>Metreon Gas Pockets:</b>   If a ship ends its maneuver touching an Objective Token or its maneuver template overlaps an Objective Token, immediately destroy 1 of its Shield Tokens and place an <img src='img/stuff/effect_auxilary.png' style="vertical-align:baseline" width='20' height='20' title='AUX Power Token'> Token beside it before taking any actions.
      <br><br>
      <b>Activating The Collector:</b>    Each End Phase, move 1 Mission Token from the Planet Token to the Minefield Token.
      <br><br>
      <b>Destroying The Collector:</b>    The Minefield Token may be attacked. It does not roll any Defense Dice when attacked. Move 1 Mission Token forom the Minefield Token to the Planet Token for each <img src='img/stuff/effect_hit.png' style="vertical-align:baseline" width='20' height='20' title='Hit Result'> or <img src='img/stuff/effect_crit.png' style="vertical-align:baseline" width='20' height='20' title='Crit Result'> result. If no more Mission Tokens remain on the Minefield Token, it is destroyed (remove the Minefield Token from the Play Area).
      <br><br>
      <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>

      <b> Map Setup: </b>  Place the Planet Token centered 8" from the S and W edges of the play area. Place the Minefield Token touching the N and E edges of the play area (this represents the Bajoran Wormhole). Place the Disabled Federation Ship so that its base is entirely within 4" of the Planet Token. Players determine initiative and set up order for their remaining ships as normal. The Federation player sets up their remaining ships with the rear edge of their bases touching the Minefield Token. The Opposing Player sets up so that their ship bases are entirely within 8" of the Planet Token, but are neither within 4" of the Planet Token, nor within 8" of the Disabled Federation Ship.<br><br>
      <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
      <b>Rescue The Captain! Hurry!:</b>    The Disabled Federation Ship cannot move, be placed, take actions, attack, nor be attacked. During the End Phase, if any other Federation ship is within Range 1 of the Disabled Federation Ship, remove the
      <img src='img/stuff/effect_disable.png' style="vertical-align:center" width='25' height='20' title='Disabled Token'>
      Token from its Ship Card. It is no longer disabled and may then act normally. <br><br>

      they choose who has the Initiative Token next turn. <br><br>
      <b>You Must Escape To Spread The Word - No Trespassing!:</b>    The Opposing Player cannot attack the Disabled Federation Ship, regardless of whether or not a

      <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
      <b>Federation Player:</b>    You win if the Disabled Federation Ship has been rescued and at least 75 SP worth of your fleet escapes to the Alpha Quadrant (including the Disabled Federation Ship).<br>

      Special Components: Planet Token, 10 Mission Tokens <br><br>
      <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
      New intelligence given to the Vulcan High Command shows that the Andorians have recovered a Xindi superweapon, and intend to use it against Vulcan. The Hight Command has sent a large Vulcan fleet to make a preemptive strike against Andoria to prevent this outrage from happening. But the Andorians have sent for reinforcements. If the Vulcan forces has not forced an Andorian surrender before the reinforcements arrive, it is only logical to assume the destruction of the strike force - and of Vulcan as well.  <br><br>
      <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
      <b> Vulcan Player: </b>    100 SP using only <img src='img/faction-vulcan.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='25' height='25' title='Vulcan'> cards. Must include at least 1 D'Kyr-Class ship and 1 Suurok-Class ship.<br>
      <b> Andorian Player: </b>    70 SP. Must not use any <img src='img/faction-vulcan.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='25' height='25' title='Vulcan'> cards. All ships in your fleet must have a hull value of 4 or less.<br><br>
      <b> Map Setup: </b>  Place the Planet Token in the center of the map with the 10 mission tokens on it. Players determine initiative and setup order as normal. The Vulcan Player sets up their fleet within 4" of the N edge of the play area, and the Andorian Player sets up their fleet within 4" of the S edge of the play area.<br><br>
      <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
      <b>Home Field Advantage:</b>    When defending within Range 1 of the Planet Token, all ships in the Andorian Player's fleet modify their Agility value by +1.<br><br>
      <b>Time Is Of The Essence:</b>    At the end of each game round, remove 1 Mission Token from the Planet Token. <br><br>
      Neither player may use a mine upgrade or an upgrade which removes or places their ship from/in the play area.
      <br><br>
      <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
      <b>Vulcan Player:</b>    You win in the End Phase if you have at least 1 ship in the play area and all enemy ships are destroyed. <br>
      <b>Andorian Player:</b>    You win in the End Phase if you have at least 1 ship in the play area, and either: All Mission Tokens have been removed from the Planet Token <b>OR</b> All enemy ships have been destroyed.<br><br>

      <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
      The Dominion fleet seems unstoppable as they attack more and more systems daily. The Federation Alliance has set up a defensive cordon to prevent any more Dominion ships from slipping into Allied territory. But Starfleet has to many commitments for the number of ships available, so the cordon is spread thin. It falls to the battle-tested Nebula-class ships, leading what few hulls are available, to hold the line, and buy time for the Federation Alliance to gear up production for a full-scale war.  <br><br>
      <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
      <b> Player/Team: </b>    130 SP. Your fleet must include the U.S.S. T'Kumbra, with Solok assigned as its Captain.<br>
      <b> Player/Team: </b>    130 SP, minimum of 3 ships.<br><br>
      <b> Map Setup: </b>  The Federation Player/Team sets up their fleet(s) within 8" of the S edge of the play area.<br>
      The Dominion Player/Team sets up their fleet(s) within 4" of the N edge of the play area.<br><br>
      <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
      <b>4-Player Setup:</b>    FEDERATION ALLIANCE TEAM (2 PLAYERS): 130 SP per player. At least on player must include the U.S.S. T'Kumbra, with Solok assigned as its Captain.<br>
      DOMINION TEAM (2 PLAYERS): 130 SP per player, minimum of 3 ships per player.<br><br>
      Players determine initiative and setup order as normal. The Federation Alliance Player/Team sets up their fleet(s) within 8" of the S edge of the play area. The Dominion Player/Team sets up their fleet(s) within 4" of the N edge of the play area.<br><br>
      Neither player may use a mind upgrade or an upgrade which removes or places their ship from/in the play area.
      <br><br>
      <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
      <b>Federation Alliance Player/Team:</b>    You win in the End Phase if you have at least 1 ship in the play area and all remaining Dominion ships are destroyed. <br>
      <b>Dominion Player/Team:</b>    You win immediately if at least half the ships in your fleet(s) rounded up have left the play area through the S edge of the play area.<br><br>
      <b>Note:</b> To adjust the game's difficulty, vary the number of required escaping Dominion ships to 2 or 4. To adjust the 4-player game's difficulty, adjust the number of players per team to 3 vs 1 or 1 vs 3. The solo player in a team game should use the full points and build restrictions of their chosen fleet.

      The Obsidian Order has been guarding the Orias Sector for an unknown, but undoubtedly shady, purpose. It's believed that they are secretly building a fleet without the knowledge of the Central Command.

      <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
      In the Caleb System the Federation has set up an outpost. The Klingon Empire has dispatched ships to destroy this outpost. Commanded by the legendary Kor, the Klingons have a plan to destroy the outpost. Can the Federation defend their outpost or will Kor lead the Klingons to victory?<br><br>

      <b> Klingon Player: </b>     80 SP, including exactly 2 D7 Class ships and 1 "Kor" Captain Card<br><br>
      <b> Map Setup: </b>  The Federation player places all the Objective Tokens in the play area face down. No Objective Token may be within Range 1 of another Objective Token nor within Range 1 of any edge of the play area. Then, the Klingon Player sets up within 4" of any edge of the play area and the Federation player sets up on the edge of the play area opposite of the one the Klingon Player set up on. Then, flip all Objective Tokens face up and place 2 Mission Tokens on each Debris Objective Token.

      <b>Debris:</b> This objective represents previously damaged portions of the outpost that are being repaired. This Objective Token is a ship for the purposes of all rules and has a Primary Weapon Value of 0, an Agility Value of 1, a Hull Value of 2, and a Shield Value of 1. At the beginning of the End Phase, the Federation Player may remove 1 Mission Token from this Objective Token to repair 1 Shield on one of their ships within Range 1.<br><br>

      During a period of strained relations with one of its neighbors, the Romulan Empire has been preparing for war. Any incidents along the Neutral Zone between the two powers could lead to a cataclysm. Naturally, now is the time that a contested planet on the boundary line was invited delegations from each side. Tensions are high, and only a small incident will lead to disaster.

      <b>Romulan Player:</b> Both players should agree upon an appropriate number of Squadron Points.<br>

      <b>Press The Diplomatic Advantage:</b> During each end phase, a Player scores +10 FP if they have more ships within Range 1 of the Planet Token than their opponent, not counting any ships that overlap or are in base contact with the Planet Token. <br><br>
      <b>Hardliners Secret Objectives:</b> At the end of Setup, the Romulan Player selects an unused maneuver dial that has White, Green, and Red Maneuvers. Set the dial to a Maneuver that has a color matching your Secret Objective and place it facedown: <br><br>

      <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
      Rumors of a new planet harboring dilithium crystals reach the ears of the Federation, as well as the Klingon and Romulan Empires. So rich is the new source that it threatens to provoke open war from the Romulan Empire, and even threatens the Khitomer Accords between the Federation and the Klingon Empire.<br><br>
      Each great power sends its closest ship to the planet to discover if the rumors are true, hoping that open war can be averted, but first each side wants to retrieve dilithium samples for analysis. The first ship to reach the planet, secure the samples, and return to its home will be able to lay claim to the discovery.<br><br>
      <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
      <b>Federation Player:</b> 40 squadron points, including at least one Federation Ship and one <img src='img/stuff/effect_crew.png' style="vertical-align:baseline" width='25' height='25' title='Crew Upgrade'> Upgrade. <br>
      <b>Klingon Player:</b> 40 squadron points, including at least one Klingon Ship and one <img src='img/stuff/effect_crew.png' style="vertical-align:baseline" width='25' height='25' title='Crew Upgrade'> Upgrade. <br>
      <b>Romulan Player:</b> 40 squadron points, including at least one Romulan Ship and one <img src='img/stuff/effect_crew.png' style="vertical-align:baseline" width='25' height='25' title='Crew Upgrade'> Upgrade.
      <br><br>
      <b> Map Setup: </b>  The ships are set up as in a standard 3-Player Game (see "3-Player Setup Diagram" on Page 7 of the rulebook). Place the Planet Token in the exact center of the play area and place the 12 Mission Tokens on the table outside of the play area.<br><br>
      <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
      Ships moving through, overlapping, or firing through the Planet Token must obey the rules for the Planet Token outlined on page 26 of the rulebook. <br><br>
      Each ship within Range 1 of the Planet Token gains the following two Actions: <br><br>
      <b>ACTION:</b> If your ship is not Cloaked, disable all of your remaining Shields and then disable your Captain and one Crew Upgrade of your choice (place Disabled Upgrade Tokens on these cards.) These two cards are considered to have beamed down onto the planet as your "Away Team" you cannot remove these Disabled Upgrade Tokens without using the Action listed below. <br><br>
      <b>ACTION:</b> If your ships is not Cloaked, disable all of your remaining Shields to remove the Disabled Upgrade Tokens from your Captain and Crew Upgrade. These two cards are now considered on board the ship and are no longer the "Away Team". <br><br>
      While beamed onto the surface of the planet, an Away Team cannot be targeted by any other cards or effects. While the Captain is part of the Away Team, their ship is considered to have a Skill of 1. <br><br>
      During the End Phase, each ship with an Away Team places 1 Mission Token on top of its Captain Card. Once the Away Team beams back aboard the ship, transfer any Mission Tokens from the Captain Card to their Ship Card. <br><br>
      <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
      Any player that possesses at least 3 Mission Tokens on their Ship Card (not their Captain Card) may enter warp by moving through their starting area and off the play area. This player immediately wins the game. <br><br>
      Any ship that leaves the play area without having 3 Mission Tokens on its Ship Card fails the Mission and loses the game. Also, any ship that leaves the play area without going through its starting area loses the game. <br><br>
      Alternatively, a player can complete the Mission by eliminating all opposing sides.

      The Federation, Klingons, and Romulans are trying to complete a computer program that is contained within secret genetic codes scattered throughout the galaxy. Each Faction races against the other in order to secure the code's knowledge and power, which is no less than the mystery of life itself.<br><br>

      <br><br>
      <b> Map Setup: </b> The ships are set up in one corner of the board. Each ship begins within a 4" x 4" square as its starting area (use Range 1 on the Range Ruler as a way of outlining 4"). The Federation and Klingon starting areas are at the exact center of each side (East and South) and the Romulan ship is in the corner (Southeast). Place 1 Mission Token beside the Romulan ship.<br><br>
      Place 1 Objective Token in each of the corners closest to the Federation and Klingon ships (Southwest and Northeast) and stack 3 Mission Tokens on top of each Objective Token. The Objective Tokens must be placed exactly 8" from both nearby edges.<br><br>
      Place the Planet Token in the corner opposite the Romulan ship (Northwest). Leave exactly 4" between the Planet Token and both nearby edges. <br><br>
      Place all remaining Mission Tokens on the table outside the play area.<br><br>
      <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
      Each Objective Token represents an abstract point in space and does not act as an Obstacle.<br><br>
      Ships moving through, overlapping, or firing through the Planet Token must obey the "Planet Token" rules outlined on page 26 of the rulebook.<br><br>
      <b>Complete The Computer Program</b><br>
      Each ship within Range 1 of an Objective Token gains the following Action: <br><br>
      <b>ACTION:</b> If you are not Cloaked, disable all of your remaining Shields and roll 1 attack die +1 attack die fro each Mission Token beside your ship (see below). If you roll at least 1
      <img src='img/stuff/effect_hit.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Hit Result'> result, you succeed at decrypting one part of the code. If you succeed, remove all Mission Tokens from beside your ship and place 1 Mission Token (from that Objective stack) on top of your Ship Card. If you fail, place a Mission Token <b>from the supply</b> (not from the Objective Token) beside your ship. You may perform this Action once per round, but you cannot attempt to secure more than 1 Mission Token for your Ship Card from the same Objective Token. <br><br>
      Once a Ship Card has acquired 2 Mission Tokens (one from each Objective Token), the ship must travel to the planet to beam down.<br><br>
      Each ship within Range 1 of the Planet Token gains the following Action: <br><br>
      <b>ACTION:</b> If your ship is not Cloaked, disable all of your remaining Shields and then disable your Captain and one Crew Upgrade of your choice (place Disabled Upgrade Tokens on these cards). These two cards are considered to have beamed down onto the planet as your "Away Team". <br><br>
      <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
      The first ship to palce two Mission Tokens on its Ship Card (one from each Objective Token) and then beam its Captain and one Crew Upgrade onto the planet completes the Mission and wins the game. A ship that is destroyed during the same round that its Captain and Crew beam down automatically loses the game. <br><br>
      Alternatively, a player may complete the Mission by eliminating all opposing ships.

An allied fleet including Xindi-Aquatic ships and a Federation ship has arrived to stop this from happening. The Sphere Builders will assist the Xindi-Reptilian and Xindi-Insectoid ships by creating spatial anomalies that will damage or destroy the allied Xindi/Federation fleet. <br><br>
  <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Xindi Player:</b> 120 SP. No ship may have a Hull value greater than 4.<br>
  <b>Allied Player:</b> 160 SP, including at least one Xindi-Aquatic cruiser and one Federation ship. No ship may have a Hull value greater than 6.<br><br>
  <b> Map Setup: </b> Place the Objective Token centered E to W along the N edge of the play area so that it touches the N edge of the play area. Players then set up as in a Standard 2-Player game. Place the Mission Tokens in a stack beside the play area.<br><br>

  A Federation ship uses a captured Xindi shuttle to get past the detection grid around Azati Prime in order to destroy the Xindi Weapon located on the planet. The Federation ship was scanned from a monitoring station on the orbiting moon and to prevent it from sending out a transmission, the station was destroyed. But when contact was lost with the lunar outpost, a squadron of Xindi ships was sent to destroy the Federation ship. <br><br>
  <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Xindi Player:</b> 100 SP, including at least one Xindi-Insectoid starship. No ship may have a Hull value greater than 4.<br>
  <b>Federation Player:</b> 40 SP, including one (and only one) Federation ship.<br><br>
  <b> Map Setup: </b> Place the Planet Token directly in the center of the play area. Place the Objective Token on the S side of the Planet Token, centered E to W so that there is exactly 4" between it and the Planet Token. Place the Mission Tokens in a stack beside the play area.

  <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Azati Prime and Moon:</b> The Planet Token represents Azati Prime and the Objective Token represents the moon that is orbiting the planet. Both are treated as normal Planet Tokens (see pg 23 of the Full Rules of Play). <br><br>
	<b>Squadron Recall:</b> Unbeknownst to the Federation ship, the Xindi shuttle that was sent to destroy the Xindi weapon was itself captured by a Xindi patrol. The captured Federation Captain attempts to negotiate with his captors, but in the meantime, the Xindi squadron is sent out to destroy the Federation ship. <br><br>
	The Mission Tokens represent the passage of time before the Xindi accepts the negotiations and the Xindi ships are recalled. At the end of each End Phase, remove 1 Mission Token from the top of the stack. When there are no more Mission Tokens in the stack, the negotiations are accepted, the Xindi ships are recalled and the game ends. <br><br>
  <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Xindi Player:</b>   You win if you destroy the Federation ship before your ships are recalled.<br><br>
  <b>Federation Player:</b>   You win if the Xindi accept your negotiations (i.e. your ship is not destroyed for 4 rounds). Alternatively, you win if you destory all of the Xindi ships. <br><br><br>
	For a more challenging mission, use 5 or 6 Mission Tokens.

  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
  While on its maiden voyage, and without a full crew, the <i>U.S.S. Enterprise</i> NCC-1701-B reluctantly responds to a distress signal from two Federation transport ships. The distressed ships are trapped in a gravimetric distortion from which they cannot escape and there is little time to save the two ships' crews before they are destroyed by this enerygy distortion ribbon. <br><br>
  <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Federation Player:</b> 40 SP, including one (and only one) ship which must be the <i>U.S.S. Enterprise-B</i>.

  <b> Map Setup: </b> Place 1 Objective Token so that there is exactly 8" between it and the W edge of the play area and exactly 12" between it and the S edge of the play area. Place a 2nd Objective Token so that there is exactly 8" between it and the E edge of the play area and exactly 12" between it and the S edge of the play area. The Federation player then sets up in a 36" x 4" area along the N edge of the play area. Place the 4 Mission Tokens on top of each Objective Token.<br><br>
  <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Transport Ships:</b> The Objective Tokens represent the 2 distressed transport ships. These ships cannot attack, move or perform Actions. They have the following stats: <br>
	Primary Weapon: 0 | Agility: 0 | Hull: 3 | Shields: 0  <br><br>
	<b>Rescuing The Crew:</b> The Mission Tokens represent the crew of the transport ships. You may attempt to rescue the crew by beaming them aboard your ship using one of the following Actions: <br><br>
	<b>ACTION:</b> Disable up to 4 of your remaining Shields and target a ship within Range 2 of your ship. If you have less than 2 Active Shields, remove 1 Mission Token from the target ship and place it on your Ship Card. <br><br>
	<br>ACTION:</b> Disable up to 4 of your remaining Shields and target a ship within Range 1 of your ship. If you have less than 2 Active Shields, remove 2 Mission Tokens from the target ship and place them on your Ship Card. <br><br>
	<b>Energy Ribbon:</b> The energy ribbon which has the transport ships trapped is harmful to any ship within it. At the end of each End Phase, roll 2 attack dice for each of the transport ships and 2 attack dice for your ship if it is within Range 1 of either of the transport ships (or 1 attack die if it is within Range 2 of either of the transport ships).

  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
  <i>"We are the Borg. Lower your shields and surrender your ships. We will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own. Your culture will adapt to service us. Resistance is futile."</i> <br><br>
  <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
	<b>*</b> Each player builds a 120 SP Fleet using the <b>Star Trek: First Contact</b> special rules and the standard Squad Building Rules (on Pg. 21 of the Full rules of Play). <br><br>
	<b>*</b> Place Cube 384 directly in the center of the play area. <br><br>
	<b>*</b> Players set up around the perimeter of the play area within Range 1 of any edge. <br><br>
	<b>*</b> Shuffle the Battle Objective Deck and Borg Attack Deck and place them face down next to the play area. <br><br>
	<b>*</b> Cube 384 starts the game with 30 shields and 30 hull for each player. Mark the total number of shields on the Shield Tracker and the total number of hull on the Hull Tracker. <br><br>
  <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
	<b>ATTACKING:</b> <br><br>
	<b>*</b> Cube 384 makes a number of attacks each turn equal to the number of players. <br><br>
	<b>*</b> Cube 384 attacks using the effect of the Borg Attack Card in play. <br><br>
	<b>*</b> Cube 384 attacks the ships closest to it. <br><br>
	<b>*</b> Cube 384 cannot target the same ship with more than one attack each turn. <br><br>
	<b>*</b> Cube 384's attacks can be cancelled, but any effect that cancels its attack only cancels the attack for the ship that activated the cancelling effect. <br><br>
	<b>*</b> Any ship that cancels an attack of Cube 384 is dealt 2 normal damage. <br><br><br>
	<b>SHIELDS AND HULL:</b>
	<b>*</b> Cube 384 cannot have its shields affected or bypassed by any game effect. <br><br>
	<b>*</b> Cube 384 is not dealt critical damage normally. Instead, when it would be dealt critical damage, it is dealt 2 normal damage. <br><br>
	<b>*</b> Cube 384 is not dalt damge cards. Instead its shields and hull are tracked on its Shield and Hull Trackers. <br><br>
	<b>*</b> Cube 384 repairs 1 damage per player to either its shields or hull at the beginning of each turn. <br><br><br>
	<b>OTHER SPECIAL RULES:</b> <br><br>
	<b>*</b> Cube 384 cannot be moved or placed by any game effect. <br><br>
	<b>*</b> Cube 384 has a Captain Skill of 5. <br><br>
	<b>*</b> Cube 384 cannot be equipped with any Captains, Admirals, Upgrades, or Resources. <br><br>
	<b>*</b> Cube 384 cannot have Auxiliary Power Tokens. <br><br>
	<b>*</b> All ships except for Cube 384 and Sphere 936 are considered to be a part of a single fleet. <br><br>
	<b>*</b> The words ship and ships on this sheet, the Borg Attack Cards, and the Battle Objective cards, refers to all ships and squadrons except for Cube 384 and Sphere 936. <br><br>
	<b>Note - Any effect listed on a Battle Objective Card or Borg Attack Card supersedes all special rules. </b><br><br><br>
	<b>TURN SEQUENCE</b> <br><br>
	At the begining of each turn, before the planning phase, resolve the below steps in order <br><br>
	<b>* Step 1 </b> Overturn the top card of the Battle Objective Deck. This is the Battle Objective Card that will be in play until the end of the turn <br><br>
	<b>* Step 2</b> Shuffle all Borg Attack Cards together. Then, overturn the top card of the Borg Attack Deck. This is the Borg Attack Card that Cube 384 will use to attack during the turn. <br><br>
	<b>* Step 3</b> Activate a Strategic Advantage effect if desired. <br><br>
	<b>* Step 4</b> Cube 384 repairs 1 damage per player to either its shields or hull. <br><br>
	<b>* Step 5</b> Resolve the rest of the turn as normal. <br><br><br>
	<b>BATTLE OBJECTIVE CARDS</b> <br><br>
	Each turn a different Battle Objective Card will be in play. While a Battle Objective Card is in play, the effect listed on the card is active. The players must complete the objective listed on the card by the end of the turn. If they do, they claim the card. If they don't, resolve the repercussions listed on the card and remove the card from the game. If there are no more Battle Objective Cards left in the deck, shuffle together all Battle Objective Cards that have been removed from the game to create a new Battle Objecitve Deck. <br><br><br>
	<b>BORG ATTACK CARDS</b> <br><br>
	At the beginning of each turn shuffle all Borg Attack Cards together (excluding any that have been removed from the game). Then, overturn the top card of the Borg Attack Deck. The overturned card shows the attack Cube 384 will use to attack during the turn. <br><br><br>
	<b>STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE EFFECTS</b> <br><br>
	Once per turn, at the beginning of the turn, after the Battle Objective Card and Borg Attack Card have been revealed for the turn, the players can activate one of the below effects by removing the appropriate amount of claimed Battle Objective Cards from the game. <br><br>
	<b>* 1 Card:</b> Cube 384 cannot repair damage to its shields or hull this turn. <br><br>
	<b>* 2 Cards:</b> Cube 384 takes 10 normal damage. <br><br>
	<b>* 3 Cards:</b> Cube 384 cannot attack this turn. <br><br><br>
	<b>SPHERE 936</b> <br><br>
	When all of Cube 384's shields are destroyed, Sphere 936 is deployed. The players place Sphere 936 touching the base of Cube 384 so that it is perpendicular to an edge of the play area and is facing away from Cube 384. Sphere 936 is treated as a normal ship with the following additional rules; Sphere 936 has a Captain Skill of 5, can only be attacked once per turn, moves using the straight 1 maneuver, cannot take actions, and attacks the ship closest to it. Additionally, when Sphere 936 is deployed, it immediately makes an attack. <br><br>
	If Sphere 936 leave the play area through any edge, it has gone through a temporal vortex and changed the course of history. The players lose the game. <br><br>
	If the players destroy Sphere 936 before it leaves the play area, the crew of the player's ships gain a moral boost which increases the primary weapon value of all ships by +1 for the rest of the game. However, the Borg are now more determined than ever to assimilate your fleet after seeing Sphere 936 get destroyed. Instead of Cube 384 repairing 1 damage per player to either its shields or hull at the beginning of each turn, Cube 384 repairs 2 damage per player to either its shields or hull at the beginning of each turn. <br><br><br>
	<b>WINNING THE GAME</b> <br><br>
	To win the game, players must destroy Cube 384 and Sphere 936 before their fleet is destroyed.

	<b>Federation Player:</b> 30 SP, including one (and only one) Federation ship which must have a Hull Value of 4 or less and must leave 1 Upgrade slot unfilled. <br><br>
  <b> Map Setup: </b> This mission uses a 36" x 60" play area. The Federation ship sets up in an 8" x 36" area along the S edge of the play area. The Romulan ships then set up in the same area, but not within 1 - 3 of the Federation ship.<br><br>

  <img src='img/stuff/effect_hit.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Hit Result'> results, treat this Action as a free Action. <br><br>
  No ship may have any Upgrade deployed to it that allows it to be removed from the play area. <br><br><br>
  <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Romulan Player:</b>   You win if you destroy the Federation ship.<br><br>

  Special Components: 1 Objective Token and 3 Mission Tokens <br><br>
  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
  An entity in the form of an enormous cloud, capable of generating the energy of thousands of starships, has entered into Klingon space. Three Klingon vessels are sent to investigate an unkown entity. <br><br>
  <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Klingon Player:</b> 100 SP, including exactly 3 Klingon ships. At least one of these ships must be a K't'inga Class ship. You must deploy at least 1 Photon Torpedoes Upgrade to each of your ships. You cannot deploy any Upgrades to any of your ships that allow a ship to be removed from the play area or any Upgrades that allow a ship to negate or cancel an entire attack.<br><br>
  <b> Map Setup: </b> Place the Objective Token centered E to W so that it touches the S edge of the play area. The Klingon player then sets up in a 4" x 36" area along the N edge of the play area. Place the 3 Mission Tokens in a stack beside the play area.<br><br>
  <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
  <b>The Entity:</b> The entity is enourmous and the S edge of the play area represents the edge of the cloud. The Objective Token represents a point in the cloud that can be target locked and fired at. The entity does not move and cannot be damaged or affected in any way. <br><br>
  Once it is fired on, at the end of each Combat Phase thereafter, the entity will attack the 2 ships that are closest to the Objective Token. The strength of the attack will vary depending on the distance the ships are away from the Objective Token as follows (to determine Ranges greater than 3, use multiple Range Rulers): <br><br>
  Range 1 - 2 = 12 attack dice, <br>
  Range 3 - 4 = 11 attack dice, <br>
  Range 5 - 6 = 10 attack dice, <br>
  Range  7 - 8 = 9 attack dice, <br>
  Range 9 or higher = 8 attack dice. <br><br>
  <b>Investigate The Unkown Entity:</b> To investigate the entity, you must fire at it with Photon Torpedoes. After a ship fires its torpedoes at the entity, place 1 Mission Token on the attack ship's Ship Card. <br><br><br>
  <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Klingon Player:</b>   You win if you successfully investigate the unkown entity and return at least one of your ships to Klingon space (i.e. exit the play area through your starting area with at least 1 of your ships and have a Mission Token on that ship's Ship Card). <br><br>
  <b>Complete Success:</b> Exit the play area through your starting area with all 3 of your ships and have a Mission Token on each ship's Ship Card. <br><br>
  <b>Partial Success:</b> Exit the play area through your starting area with at least 2 of your ships and have a Mission Token on each of those ship's Ship Cards. <br><br>
  <b>Marginal Success:</b> Exit the play area through your starting area with at least 1 of your ships nad have a Mission Token on that ship's Ship Card. <br><br>

  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
  Most of the Dominion forces have withdrawn from the Chin'toka system, but the system was not left as undefended as the Federation Alliance forces would have believed. The Cardassians have deployed many orbital weapon platforms around each of the planets in the system. Can the Federation Alliance advance ships destroy these weapon platforms? Or will the Cardassian defenses turn back the advancing fleet? <br><br>
  <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Dominion Player:</b> 120 SP, including at least 3 Dominion ships. <br><br>
	<b>Federation Alliance Player:</b> 150 SP, including at least 3 Federation, Romulan, or Klingon ships. One of these ships must be a <i>Saber Class</i> ship. <br><br>
  <b> Map Setup: </b> The Dominion player places the Objective Token anywhere in the play area, but not within Range 2 of any edge of the play area. Players then set up as in a Standard 2-Player game.<br><br>
  <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>

  <b>The Fleet Arrives:</b> The Mission Token represents the passing of time. At the end of each End Phase, remove 1 Mission Token from the stack. When the last Mission Token is removed, the remainder of the Federation fleet has arrived and the game ends. <br><br><br>
  <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Federation Player:</b>   You win if you destroy all of the Dominion ships before the rest of your fleet arrives (i.e. the last Mission Token is removed from the game).<br><br>
  <b>Dominion Player:</b>   You win if you destroy all of the Federation ships. <br><br>

  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
  At the beginning of the Dominion War, the <i>U.S.S. Valiant</i> find itself behind enemy lines and encounters a Cardassian ship near the El-Gatark region. In the battle, both ships are damaged and lose main power. Adrift in space, it is a race against the clock by both ships to attempt to restore power. Whichever ship manages to do this first will gain a decisive advantage. <br><br>
  <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Dominion Player:</b> 40 SP, including one (and only one) Dominion ship. <br><br>
	<b>Federation Player:</b> 40 SP, including one (and only one) <i>Defiant</i>-class ship which must be the <i>U.S.S. Valiant</i>. <br><br>
  <b> Map Setup: </b> Place the Planet Token directly in the center of the play area. Players then set up as in a Standard 2-Player game. Place the 5 Mission Tokens in 2 stacks beside each Ship Card, with a stack of 2 on the left side of each card and a stack of 3 on the right side of each card.<br><br>
  <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Main Power And Weapons:</b> At the start of the game, both ships are considered to be without main power and weapons. The stack of Mission Tokens to the <u>left</u> of each Ship Card represents the time it will take to restore <u>main power</u>. While there are any Mission Tokens in this stack, that ship cannot perform any maneuver with a speed greater than 1. This includes any additional maneuvers gained from Actions or text abilites. <br><br>
  The stack of Mission Tokens to the <u>right</u> of each Ship Card represents the time it will take to restore the <u>ship's weapons</u>. While there are any Mission Tokens in this stack, the ship can only perform attacks with their Primary Weapon as if they had a Primary Weapon value of "1", and cannot perform any attacks with secondary weapons. <br><br>
  During the Activation Phase, as ship may use one of the following Actions: <br><br>
  <b>ACTION:</b> Remove 1 Mission Token from a stack on either side of your Ship Card. <br> <b>OR</b> <br>
  <b>ACTION:</b> Inflict 4 damage to your ship's Hull or Shields and remove 2 Mission Tokens from a stack on either side of your Ship Card. <br><br>
  Once the <u>main power</u> is restored (i.e. there are no more Mission Tokens left in the stack to the <u>left</u> of the Ship Card), that ship may move as normal. <br><br>
  once the <u>ship's weapons</u> are restored (i.e. there are no more Mission Tokens left in the stack to the <u>right</u>of the Ship Card), that ship may attack as normal. <br><br><br>
  <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Federation Player:</b>   You win if you destroy the Dominion player's ship.<br><br>
  <b>Dominion Player:</b>   You win if you destroy the Federation player's ship.

  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
  A Romulan scount vessel has entered into Federation space and is near the planet Galorndon Core. The ship is on a covert mission and a Romulan Warbird, which is still in the Neutral Zone, remains in contact with the scout vessel. A nearby Federation <i>Galaxy</i>-class ship has intercepted a message between the two Romulan ships and has been dispatched to the planet. Will the Romulan scout vessel complete its mission and return to Romulan space with the gathered information? <br><br>
  <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Romulan Player:</b> 70 SP, including one Romulan scout vessel and one other Romulan ship. <br><br>
	<b>Federation Player:</b> 50 SP, including one (and only one) Federation ship. <br><br>
  <b> Map Setup: </b> Place the Planet Token directly in the center of the play area. Place the 4 Objective Tokens so that one Token is to the N, S, E and W of the Planet Token and there is 4" between each Token and the Planet Token. The N and S Tokens are entered E to W and the E and W Tokens are centered N to S. The Romulan player sets up one ship in a 4" x 4" area along the N edge of the player area in the NW corner and the 2nd ship in a 4" x 4" area along the N edge of the play area in the NE corner. The Federation player sets up in a 4" x 4" area, centered E to W along teh S edge of the play area. Place 1 Mission Token on top of each Objective Token.<br><br>
  <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Galorndon Core:</b> The Planet Token represents the planet Galorndon Core. The planet's atmosphere has created severe electromagnetic storms. Any ship that ends its move within Range 1 of the Planet Token must roll 2 attack dice. That ship suffers 1 damage for each

  <b>Covert Mission:</b> The 4 Objective Tokens represent points in space where the Romulan scout vessel must gather the information vital to its mission. The Mission Tokens represent the information that is to be gathered. If the Romulan scout vessel's Ship Base or Maneuver Template overlaps an Objective Token, that ship may perform the following Action: <br><br>
  <b>ACTION:</b> If you Ship's Base or Maneuver Template overlapped an Objective Token this round, remove the Mission Token from on top of that Objective Token and place it on your Ship Card. You cannot perform any free Actions or attack this round. NOTE: Only 1 Mission Token can be gathers from each Objective Token. <br><br>
  <b>Act Of War:</b> If the Federation ship attacks either Romulan ship before the scout vessel has gathered any information, the Federation player has declared an Act of War. If a Romulan ship attacks the Federation ship before the Federation ship attacks either Romulan ship, the Romulan player has declared an Act of War. If a play declares an Act of War, that player immediately loses. <br><br><br>
  <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Romulan Player:</b>   You win if your scout vessel gathers enough information (i.e. has 2 or 3 Mission Tokens on its Ship Card) and exits the play area through the N edge of the play area. Alternatively, you win if you destroy the Federation ship after it has attacked one of your ships.<br>
  COMPLETE SUCCESS: The scout vessel gathers 3 Mission Tokens and exits the play area. <br>
  MARGINAL SUCCESS: The scout vessel gathers 2 Mission Tokens and exits the play area. <br><br>
  <b>Federation Player:</b>   You win if you destroy the Romulan scout vessel after it has collected one or more Mission Tokens. <br>
  COMPLETE SUCCESS: Destroy the scout vessel after it gathers 1 Mission Tokens. <br>
  MARGINAL SUCCESS: Destroy the scout vessel after it gathers 2 - 3 Mission Tokens.

  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
  A peace treaty between the Federation and the Cardassian Union has recently been established. Believing that the Cardassians have broken this treaty and are arming themselves, Captain Benjamin Maxwell attacked and destroyed a Cardassian outpost in the Cuellar system. Maxwell's unauthorized campaign of vengeance continued as he destroyed 2 Cardassian vessels. The Federation has sent the <i>U.S.S. Enterprise-D</i> to intercept the <i>U.S.S Phoenix</i> and return with them to Starbase 211 before any more damage is done.
  <br><br>
  <!-- Setup -->
  <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>

  Primary Weapon: 0 | Agility: 0 | Hull: 3 | Shields: 1 <br><br>
  <b>Cardassian Ships:</b> The Cardassian ships have been caught off guard by the attacks and, as such, all of the Cardassian ships' Captains and Upgrades begin the game disabled. At the start of the game, place a Disabled Upgrade Token on each of the Cardassian player's Captain and Upgrade Cards. <br><br>

  A Species 8472 bioship has been severely damaged by an enemy ship. The bioship retreats into an asteroid field, but the enemy ship follows it, confident that it can finish off its prey. Realizing that it might not be able to defeat the enemy vessel with its damaged ship, the bioship's pilot tried a desperate move and exits his ship onto one of the asteroids to face the enemy captain and make a final stand.
  <br><br>

  <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
  <!-- Player 1 -->
  <b>Species 8472 Player:</b> 60 SP, including one (and only one) Species 8472 Bioship with the Bioship Beta Pilot assigned as its captain.
  <br><br>
  <!-- Player 2 -->
  <b>Enemy Player:</b> 60 SP, including one (and only one) non-Borg ship.<br><br>
  <!-- Map Setup -->
  <b>Map Setup:</b> Starting with the Species 8472 player, both players alternate placing 1 Objective Token anywhere in the play area. Once all of the Objective Tokens have been placed, playes continue to alternate and place the 6 Mission Tokens anywhere in the play area (for a more challenging game use 8, 10, or 12 Mission Tokens). No Token may be placed within 4" of another Token or any edge of the play area. Players then set up as in a Standard 2-Player game.<br><br>
  <!-- Special Rules -->
  <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Damaged Ship:</b> The Species 8472 Bioship begings the game with no Shields remaining and 1 Damage to its Hull. In addition, all of its Upgrades begin the game disabled. At the start of the game, place a Disabled Upgrade Token on each of its Upgrades. <br><br>
  <b>Asteroid Field:</b> The Objective Token and the Mission Tokens represent asteroids of 2 different sizes. Treat these as Obstacles (see pg 22 of the Rules of Play). In addition, if a ship is within Range 1 of one of the larger asteroids (i.e. the Objectve Tokens) that ship may send an Away Team to that asteroid by using the following Action: <br><br>
  ACTION: Disable all of your remaining Shields and place a Disabled Upgrade Token on your Captain Card and/or any number of your
  <img src='img/stuff/effect_crew.png' style="vertical-align:baseline" width='20' height='20' title='Crew Upgrade'> Upgrades. These cards are now considered a part of your Away Team. NOTE: This Action cannot be used until the 5th round of play. <br><br>
  <b>Battle On The Asteroid:</b> Once the Species 8472 ship has an Away Team, that ship cannot move, perform Actions or be attacked for the remainder of the game. Once both players have an Away Team on the same asteroid, the space battle ends and the battle on the asteroid begins. Players attack each other simultaneously. The Away Team with the higher Skill rolls 1 extra die (attack or defense). The enemy player rolls 1 attack die and 1 defense die for his/her Captain Card and for each
  <img src='img/stuff/effect_crew.png' style="vertical-align:baseline" width='20' height='20' title='Crew Upgrade'> Upgrade in his Away Team. The Species 8472 player rolls 2 attack dice and 2 defense dice for his Away Team. Any

  <img src='img/stuff/effect_crit.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Crit Result'> results in damage to the opposing Away Team. Each card in the Away Team requires 1 damage to destroy it. NOTE: The Species 8472 player's Away Team may use the "Biogenic Field" and/or the "Biological Technology" Upgrades if those Upgrades were assigned to his ship and were not disabled when the Away Team was send to the asteroid. Any Mission Tokens that were on the "Biological Technology" Upgrade at that time remain in effect. In addition, the Bioship Beta Pilot may use his re-roll ability during this battle.

          <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
          You've been sent on a mission to explore a newly discovered and explored sector of space that has signs of intelligent life. As you being exploring and scanning the outer rim of the sector you come upon four spherical objects that are completely smooth. Your scanners don't show anything anomalous about them, but as you approach each of them begins to open slightly. As you get closer you see a red glow appear out of each of them and they begin firing at you. It appears that each of these spheres is actually an automated sentry turret meant to defend this area! As you take evasive maneuvers to avoid any additional damage to your ship an enemy fleet appears. You must not combat the enemy fleet while also fending off the mysterious spheres!<br><br>
          <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
          <b> Both Players: </b>   130 SP per player.<br><br>
          <b> Map Setup: </b>   Each player, starting with the play with Initiative, takes turns placing the objective tokens in the play area, one at a time. Each objective token must be within 12" of the center of the play area and at least 8" from each other and from each starting area.<br><br>
          Afterwards, the players place their ships in their starting areas according to the normal Set-Up rules for two players.<br><br>
          <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
          All objective tokens represent automated sentry turrets equipped with phasers that are considered obstacles and enemy ships.<br><br>
          Each automated sentry turret has advanced hull plating and self-repair capabilities. As such, they are immune to critical effects and automatically reduce all damage dealt to them by 2. When an automated sentry turret sustains damage, use mission tokens to mark damage against them. When an automated sentry turret has three or more mission tokens on it, remove all mission tokens from it and place one time token on it. It is not in self-repair mode and cannot attack, be attacked, or be targeted for the rest of the turn. Remove all time tokens from all automated sentry turrets at the end of the turn.<br><br>
          At the end of each combat phase, each automated sentry turret that is not in self-repair mode attacks the closest ship within range 1 - 3 with 4 attack dice. Fire each automated sentry turret in ascending order based on the Captain Skill of the ship's being targeted. If it cannot be determined which ship is the closest, of those ships treat the ship with the lowest Captain Skill as the closest. If multiple ships have the same Captain Skill, of those ships, the ship whose player has Initiative is considered closest. If multiple ships are owned by the same player and have the same Captain Skill, of those ships the opposing player chooses which ship is the closest. <br><br>
          <b>END OF THE MISSION:</b><br><br>
          The mission ends when: <br><br>
          1. One player is eliminated <br><br>
          2. The time limit is reached <br><br>
          <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
          1. Destroy all your opponent's ships <br><br>
          2. Have more Fleet Points than your opponent for that Battle Round. <br>
            a. If players have the same Fleet Points for that Battle Round, one player rolls five attack dice and the other player rolls five defense dice. The player who rolls the most <img src='img/stuff/action_battlestations.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Battlestation'> results wins.<br><br>
          BONUS<br><br>
          Each time a player causes a turret to go into self-repair mode they earn +10 Fleet Points.<br><br><br>

          <b>(Cloaked Mines, Antimatter Mines, etc.)</b><br><br>
          <b> Map Setup: </b>  Shuffle the objective tokens, and place the first one face down in the center of the play area. Then, starting with the player with Initiative, the players take turns place the other objective tokens face down throughout the play area, such that they are not within range 1 of the starting areas or another objective token.<br><br>
          Afterwards, the players place their ships in their starting areas according to the normal Set-Up rules for two players.<br><br>
          <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
          Each objective token acts as a normal obstacle and represents a different type of cloaked trap that can be dangerous for any ships that end their movement near it. A ship that ends its movement within range 1 of an objective token may perfomr the following action to attempt to scan and disable the trap:<br><br>
          <b>ACTION:</b> Roll a number of defense dice equal to your current Agility Value. If you roll at least 1 <img src='img/stuff/action_evade.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Evade'> result, the trap is considered disarmed. Place the objective token on your side of the play area <b>face down</b>. You may peek at this objective token, but you do not have to share the information with the other player. <br><br>
          If the ship fails to disarm the trap, or does not attempt to disarm the trap, and the trap is still on the f ield at the end of the Activation Phase, then the trap goes off. Carefully flip the objective token over so that you may reveal its image, and consult the Trap chart below. Afterwards remove the objective token from the play area.<br><br>
          <b>NOTE:</b> If a ship ends it movement within range 1 of several traps, it can only attempt to disarm one of them. <br><br>
          TRAPS<br><br>
          1. Space Station: Make a 3 Dice Primary Weapon Attack against all ships within range 1.<br><br>
          2. Asteroid Field: All ships within range 1 sustain 2 damage. Defense dice can be rolled against this damage. <br><br>
          3. Derelict Ship: All ships within range 1 - 3 sustain 1 damage. Defense dice cannot be rolled against this damage. <br><br>
          4. Debris: All ships within range 1 sustain 1 damage to their Hull and receive an Auxiliary Power Token. Defense dice cannot be rolled against this damge. <br><br>
          <b>END OF THE MISSION:</b><br><br>
          The mission ends when: <br><br>
          1. One player is eliminated <br><br>
          2. The time limit is reached <br><br>
          <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
          1. Destroy all your opponent's ships <br><br>
          2. Have more Fleet Points than your opponent for that Battle Round. <br>
            a. If players have the same Fleet Points for that Battle Round, one player rolls five attack dice and the other player rolls five defense dice. The player who rolls the most <img src='img/stuff/action_battlestations.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Battlestation'> results wins.<br><br>
          BONUS<br><br>
          Each trap a player disarms is worth +10 Fleet Points.<br><br><br>

          <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
          Your fleet arrives at th scene of a massacre of several ships of unknown origin. You've been tasked with recovering anything of interest from the scene in order to bolster your fleet as well as preventing any opposing factions from gathering anything potentially harmful. As you start moving through and scanning the remains of the ships, your sensors detect an approaching enemy fleet. You must recover as many of the resources as possible while fending off your foes and preventing them from doing the same! Will you succed in your venture or will you fail and let your enemies salvage potentially deadly technology to use against you in the future?<br><br>
          <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
          <b> Both Players: </b>   130 SP per player.<br><br>
          All players must use at least one resource and can use a number of resources equal to the number of ships in their fleet. This supersedes the normal rules limiting each fleet to one resource. All resources are paid for and equipped normally but start the game <b>face down</b>. A face down resource cannot be used and cannot be affected until it is discovered during the mission by analyzing one of the abandoned resource caches (see below). <br><br>
          <b> Map Setup: </b>  Place 1 objective token in the center of the play area, and place the other 2 objective tokens 8" from the east and west edges, centered from north to south.<br><br>
          Afterwards, the players place their ships in their starting areas according to the normal Set-Up rules for two players. <br><br>
          <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
          ABANDONED RESOURCE CACHES<br><br>
          Each objective token represents an abandoned resource cache, which acts as an obstacle. A ship within range 1 of one or more of these abandoned resource caches may use the following action:<br><br>
          <b>ACTION:</b> Roll 1 attack die. If a blank is rolled, nothing happens, If a
          <img src='img/stuff/action_battlestations.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Battlestation'>,

          <img src='img/stuff/effect_crit.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Crit Result'> is rolled, shuffle all of your face down resources under the table and randomly select one (still under the table). Flip the chosen resource face up. You may now use this resource as normal.
         <br><br>
          <b>END OF THE MISSION:</b><br><br>
          The mission ends when: <br><br>
          1. One player is eliminated <br><br>
          2. The time limit is reached <br><br>
          <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
          1. Destroy all your opponent's ships <br><br>
          2. Have more Fleet Points than your opponent for that Battle Round. <br>

          Special Components:<br><br>
          * 5 Objective Tokens: 2 Space Stations, 1 Asteroid Field, 1 Debris, 1 Derelict Ship<br><br>
          * 24 Mission Tokens
          <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
          Your fleet arrives in an unexplored sector of space to investigate a series of subspace anomalies causing large scale time fluctuations across the quadrant. As you arrive your sensors detect an enemy fleet coming out of warp nearby. You have direct orders to investigate the anomalies to figure out their source, but you cannot simply ignore your most hated enemies while doing so. As you engage in combat and start investigating these anomalies you realize that they are actually tears in space and time which bridge multiple universes! Will you use these anomalies to your advantage to defeat your enemies or will you try and find the source of the anomalies as quickly as possible and leave your enemy behind?<br><br>
          <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
          <b> Both Players: </b>   130 SP per player.<br><br>
          No ship may have an oversized base.<br><br>
          No ship may equip any upgrade that removes a ship from the play area (such as Warp Jump).<br><br>
          No ship may equip any upgrade that changes an enemy ship's maneuver (such as Lure, Thought Maker, or Faked Messages).<br><br>
          <b> Map Setup: </b>  Place one of the Space Station Objective Tokens face up in the center of the play area. Afterwards, shuffle the remaining objective tokens face down and hand two of them to each player (who cannot peek at them). Starting with the player with the Initiative, the players take turns place the tokens face down in the play area such that no token is within range 2 of any edge of the play area or within range 2 of any other token. Once all the tokens have been placed, carefully flip them face up, and then remove the second Space Station Objective Token so that only 4 Objective Tokens remain in the play area (1 Space Station, 1 Asteroid Field, 1 Debris, and 1 Derelict Ship). <br><br>
          Place the Mission Tokens off to one side of the play area. <br><br>
          Afterwards, the players place their ships in their starting areas per the normal Set-Up rules for two players.<br><br>
          <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
          SUBSPACE ANOMALIES<br><br>
          Each objective token represents subspace anomalies.<br><br>
          Each of the subpace anomalies is numbers:<br><br>
          1. Space Station <br><br>
          2. Derelict Ship <br><br>
          3. Asteroid Field <br><br>
          4. Debris <br><br>
          A ship that passes through one of the objective tokens is displaced into another universe. These alternate universes can only be entered by moving each of your individual ships across the objective tokens in ascending order: <br><br>
          Space Station > Derelict Ship > Asteroid Field > Debris <br><br>
          The number of mission tokens on a ship's base (see below) will indicate which universe that ship is currently in. A ship is consirdered to pass through a subspace anomaly when any part of its base or template touch the objective token.<br><br>
          When a ship passes through a subspace anomaly and the number of the objective token (see above) is exaclty one hight than the number of mission tokens on the ship's base, then immediately place one more mission token on the ship's base. If a ship passes through a subspace anomaly prematurely or passes through the same subspace anomaly a second time, there is no effect. <br><br>
          <b><font size="+1">IMPORTANT:</font></b> A ship can only affect another ship if both ships have the same number of mission tokens on their bases. <br><br>
          When an effect that places a token on the board is used (i.e. Cloaked Mines, Antimatter Mines, etc.) place a number of mission tokens on that token equal to the number of mission tokens on the base of the ship that the effect originated from. Only ships that have the same number of mission tokens on their base as the token can be affected by that token. <br><br>
          <b>END OF THE MISSION:</b><br><br>
          The mission ends when: <br><br>
          1. Any ship has four mission tokens at the end of the round. <br><br>
          2. One player is elminiated <br><br>
          3. The time limit is reached <br><br>
          <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
          1. Have the most ships with four mission tokens on their bases at the end of the game. <br>
            a. If players have the same number of ships with four missions tokens on their bases, of those tied ships, the player whose ship has the highest Captain Skill wins the mission. If the ships have the same Captain Skill, the player who has Initiative wins the mission. <br><br>
          2. Have the ship with the most mission tokens on its base at the end of the game. <br>
            a. If both players have a ship with the most mission tokens on their bases, of those tied ships, the player whose ship has the highest Captain Skill wins the mission. If the ships have the same Captain Skill, the player who has Initiative wins the mission.<br><br>

          <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
          An enemy fleet waits to ambush your ship as you complete the end of the third segment of the Antarian Trans-stellar Rally, a race that covers 2.3 billion kilometers through obstacles that include dwarf star clusters and K-class anomalies.<br><br>
          <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
          <b> Both Players: </b>   130 SP per player.<br><br>
          <b> Map Setup: </b><br>
          * Place 1 Objective Token in the play area, centered from E to W so that there is exactly 12" between it and the N edge of the play area.<br><br>
          * Place 1 Objective Token in the play area, centered from E to W so that there is exactly 12" between it and the S edge of the play area. <br><br>
          * The players then set up using the Standard 2-Player Rules (see page 6 of the Full Rules of Play) with the following exceptions: <br><br>
          - Player 1 sets their Racer <i>(see below)</i> in a 4" x 4" area along the E edge of the play area (which starts exactly 12" from the N edge) and all of their other ships in a 4" x 12" area in the NW corner of the play area. <br><br>
          - Player 2 sets their Racer <i>(see below)</i> in a 4" x 4" area along the E edge of the play area (which starts exactly 12" from the S edge) and all of their other ships in a 4" x 12" area in the SW corner of the play area. <br><br>
          * Place 3 Mission Tokens in a stack beside the play area. At the end of each End Phase, remove on Mission Token from the stack.<br><br>
          <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
          RACER<br><br>
          * Each fleet must include 1 ship that is considered to be its "Racer". These ships must have a Hull Value of 3 or less. <br><br>
          * During Set Up, neither players' Racer can be facing directly N nor directly S and must be facing part of the W edge of the play area. <br><br>
          - To determine if a ship is facing the W edge, choose one side of the ship's base. For this purpose, the side of the base extends all the way to the edge of the play area. If the lines goes through the W edge, it is considered to be facing the W edge. <br><br>
          * During the Planning Phase, a Racer cannot choose a maneuver on its Maneuver Dial with a speed greater than 3 until: <br><br>
          1) One or both Racers have crossed the finish line, OR <br><br>
          2) There are no Mission Tokens left in the stack. <br><br>
          CROSSING THE FINISH LINE <br><br>
          The Objective Tokens and the space between the Objective Tokens represent the finish line. These are not Obstacles and are treated only as points in space. <br><br>
          When a ship executes a maneuver in which either the Maneuver Template or the ship's base physically overlaps one of the Objective Tokens or the space between then Objective Tokens, it is considered to have crossed the finish line. <br><br>
          NOTE: If a ship ends up beyond the Objective Tokens, but neither its Maneuver Template nor its base overlapped the finish line, that ship is considered to have not crossed the finish line. <br><br>
          WINNING THE RACE <br><br>
          Only a ship that crosses the finish line can be considered the winner of the race. The winner o the race is determined in one of 2 ways: <br><br>
          1) If one Racer crosses the finish line and the other does not, the ship that crossed the finish line is considered  to be the winner, OR <br><br>
          2) If both Racers cross the finish line in the same round, the Racer that ends its move closer to the W edge of the play area is considered to be the winner. <br><br>
          The winning Racer immediately places an <b>[Evade]</b> Token beside its ship. <br><br>
          AMBUSHING FLEET <br><br>
          Neither player's ships (other than their Racers) can do anything until: <br><br>
          1) Their Racer has crossed the finish line, OR <br><br>
          2) The last Mission Token is removed from the stack. <br><br>
          Once a player's Racer crosses the finish line, that player may use the rest of their ships as normal. <br><br>
          NOTE: It is possible for 1 player to be able to use all of their ships in a round while the other cannot. <br><br>
          THE GAME ENDS WHEN one player is eliminated or the time limit is reached. <br><br>

          Special Components:<br><br>
          1 Planet Token, 12 Mission Tokens<br><br>
          <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
          While attempting to obtain new technology from a ship that is in an orbital facility near a gas giant in the Vintaak system, your fleet is set upon by an enemy fleet. As the battle progresses, the Tholian ships in the area begin to form their energy web around your fleets.<br><br>
          Can you evade the Tholian Web and defeat your opponent? <br><br>
          <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
          <b> Both Players: </b>   130 SP per player.<br><br>
          <b> Map Setup: </b><br>
          * Place a Planet Token centered from N to S so that there is exactly 4" between it and the E edge of the play area.<br><br>
          * Place one Mission Token in the NW corner of the play area, so that there is exactly 12" between it and the N edge of the play area and exactly 4" between it and the W edge of the play area. <br><br>
          * Place one Mission Token in the SW corner of the play area, so that there is exactly 12" between it and the S edge of the play area and exactly 4" between it and the W edge of the play area. <br><br>
          * The players then set up using the Standard 2-Player rules <i>(see pg. 6 of the Rules of Play)</i>.<br><br>
          <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
          GAS GIANT<br><br>
          The Planet Token represents the gas giant. Treat this as a regular Planet Token <i>(see pg. 23 of the Rules of Play)</i> with the following exceptions: <br><br>
          * Any ship that executes a maneuver in which the Maneuver Template overlaps the gas giant suffers one damage. <br>
          * Any ship that overlaps the gas giant at the end of its movement must back up along its Maneuver Template as normal and suffers two additional damage. The ship also skips the "Perform Action" step as normal. <br><br>
          THOLIAN SHIPS <br><br>
          The Mission Tokens represent the Tholian ships. These tokens cannot attack or be attacked, cannot move or perform Actions, and cannot be affected in any way. <br><br>
          At the end of each game round, starting with the player whose ship has the highest Captain Skill (resolve ties normally), each player places another Mission Token in the play area with the following restrictions. The new Tokens: <br><br>
          1) Must be placed within Range 1 of another Mission Token that was already in the play area at the start of the round, <br>
          AND <br>
          2) Cannot be placed within Range 1 of any ship or the Planet Token. <br><br>
          THOLIAN WEB <br><br>
          At the end of every Activation Phase, after all ships have moved, check for damage to ships from the Tholian Web. <br><br>
          Place the Range Ruler between two Mission Tokens within Range 3 of each other, measuring the closest distance between them. If the Range Ruler overlaps a ship's base, that ship suffers one damage. <br><br>
          Repeat this process for every set of two Mission Tokens that are within Range 3 of each other. <br><br>
          NOTE: A ship may suffer more than one damage in a round if it lies between multiple sets of Mission Tokens, that are within Range 3 of each other. <br><br>
          <i> For Example: <br><br>
            A ship finds itself amongst three Mission Tokens that are within Range 3 of each other. <br><br>
            The Range Ruler is placed between Mission Token A and Mission Token B. The Range Ruler overlaps the ship's base, so the ship suffers one damage. <br><br>
            The Range Ruler is then placed between Mission Token B and Mission Token C. The Range Ruler overlaps the ship's base, so the ship suffers one additional damage. <br><br>
            The Range Ruler is then placed between Mission Token A and Mission Token C. The Range Ruler does not overlap the ship's base, so the ship does not suffer any additional damage. </i> <br><br>
            THE GAME ENDS WHEN one player is eliminated of the time limit is reached. <br><br>
          <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
          Destroy all of your opponent's ships.<br><br>

          Special Components:<br><br>
          1 Objective Token <br><br>
          <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
          Your fleet has encounterd a damaged ship from the past that has emerged from a strange temporal rift. While repairing it, you realize that this ship has caused your timeline to be altered and have determined that it must return through the rift to its own time to set things right. As your fleet escourts the damaged ship back to the rift, you are set upon by an enemy fleet.<br><br>
          Will you successfully return the damaged ship to its own  time? Or will the ship be destroyed on route to the rift, leaving you stuck in this alternate timeline? <br><br>
          <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
          <b> Both Players: </b>   130 SP per player.<br><br>
          <b> Map Setup: </b><br>
          * Place an Objective Token centered N to S so that it touches the E edge of the play area.<br><br>
          * The players then set up using the Standard 2-Player rules <i>(see pg. 6 of the Rules of Play)</i> with the following exceptions:<br><br>
          * Player 1 must place his/her damaged ship <i>(see below)</i> in a 4" x 4" area in the NW corner of the play area. Player 1 then sets up the rest of his/her fleet in an 8" x 15" area in the NW corner of the play area. <br><br>
          * Player 2 must place his/her damaged ship <i>(see below)</i> in a 4" x 4" area in the SW corner of the play area. Player 2 then sets up the rest of his/her fleet in an 8" x 15" area in the SW corner of the play area. <br><br>
          <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
          TEMPORAL RIFT <br><br>
          The Objective Token represents the Temporal Rift. When a ship executes a maneuver in which either the Maneuver Template or the ship's base physically overlaps the Objective Token that ship is considered to have entered the rift and is immediately removed from the play area for the rest of the game. <br><br>
          In addition, if a ship extis the play area within Range 1 of the Objective Token, it is also considered to have entered the rift and is immediately removed from the play area for the rest of the game. <br><br>
          DAMAGED SHIPS <br><br>
          One ship in each player's fleet is considered to be the damaged ship that is attempting to enter the temporal rift. Place Critical Hit Tokens beside both of these ships. These tokens cannot be removed for the duration of the game.<br><br>
          The damaged ship: <br><br>
          1) May only have a Hull value of 4 or less. <br><br>
          2) May not execute a maneuver with a speed greater than 3. <br><br>
          3) Must be assigned a Captain and may only be equipped with one Upgrade card with a printed cost of 5 SP or less. NOTE: This Upgrade's ability cannot allow the damaged ship to be removed from the play area or execute an additional maneuver. <br><br>
          4) Begins the game with one damage to its Hull. Take one damage card from the Damage Deck and place it beside the ship's Ship Card. <br><br>
          5) May transfer a number of damage that receives from an attack to a friendly ship that is within Range 1 of the damaged ship equal to the friendly ship's remaining Shields. Any excess damage hits the damaged ship as normal. <br><br>
          TEMPORAL DISPLACEMENT <br><br>
          At the start of the game, during the Gather Forces step, each player must flip 1/2 of the Upgrades assigned to each of his/her ships face down <i>(round up)</i>. These Upgrades cannot be used until that player's damaged ship enters the temporal rift <i>(see above)</i>. This does not apply to an Upgrade assigned to the player's damaged ship. <br><br>
          Once a player's damaged ship enters the rift, immediately flip all of that player's face down cards face up. Those cards are usable immediately. <br><br>
          <i>For Example: Player 1 has the U.S.S. Enterprise-D with the Jadzia Dax Crew Upgrade and a Photon Torpedeo Weapon Upgrade assigned to it face down. That player's damaged ship move before the Enterprise-D and has entered the temporal rift, so both the Jadzia Dax and Photo Torpedo Upgrade cards are flipped face up. When the Enterprise-D moves this turn it may use Jadzia Dax's Action to perform an additional 2 forward or bank maneuver and during the Combat Phase, it may fire the Photon Torpedo Upgrade as normal. </i><br><br>
          In addition, when a player's damaged ship enters the rift, remove all Disabled Upgrade Tokens from on top of all of that Player's Upgrade cards. <br><br>
          NOTE: An Upgrade card that is flipped face up cannot add Upgrade slot(s) to its ship. <br><br>
          THE GAME ENDS WHEN one player is eliminated or the time limit is reached. <br><br>
          <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
          Destroy all of your opponent's ships.<br><br>
          <b>Bonus:</b> At the end of the game, each player whose damaged ship enters the temporal rift gains +10 Fleet Points. <br><br>
          <b>Bonus:</b> At the end of the game, each player gains +10 Fleet Points for destroying their opponent's damaged ship. <br><br><br>

				<b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
				The Rite of Succession has ben completed and Gowron is named the new leader of the Klingon High Council. After boarding his flagship, Gowron prepares to leave Qo'noS, but is immediately set upon by an enemy fleet. The House of Duras does not agree with the decision of the Arbiter of Succession and attempts to kill Gowron. <br><br>
				Will they succeed? Or will Gowron's fleet thwart the assassination attempt?<br><br>
				<b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
				<b> Both Players: </b>   130 SP per player.<br><br>

				PLANET TOKEN <br><br><br>
				This token represents Qo'noS. Treat this as a regular Planet Token <i>(see pg. 23 of the Rules of Play)</i>. <br><br><br>
				GOWRON <br><br>
				Each player must have Gowron assigned to a ship in his/her fleet. This can be accomplished in one of two ways: <br><br>
				1) COVERTLY: Prior to the start of the game, before any ships are set up, the player secretly records on a separate sheet of paper which ship in his/her fleet has Gowron assigned to it. There are no penalties, special abilities, or bonuses gained by Gowron being covertly assigned to a ship. <br><br>
				If this method is used, no Gowron card is physically assigned to a ship in that player's fleet, but Gowron is considered to be aboard that ship. <br><br>
				OR <br><br>
				2) OPENLY: The player assigns a Gowron Captain or Admiral Card to one of the ships in his/her fleet. <br><br>
				If this method is used, there is no cost for the Gowron Captain or Admiral Card. <br><br><br>
				TRANSFERRING GOWRON <br><br>
				During the Activation Phase, a ship that has Gowron aboard it may perform one of the following Actions to transfer Gowron to another ship in his/her fleet: <br><br>
				<b>ACTION:</b> If Gowron is OPENLY aboard your ship and your ship is not Cloaked and has no Active Shields, target a friendly ship at Range 1 - 2 that is not Cloaked and has no Active Shields. Remove the Gowron Card from your ship and assign it to the target ship. If the Gowron Card is a Captain Card and there is another Captain Card already on the target ship, that ship must flip the Captain Card face down and use the Gowron Card as its new Captain. Your ship now has a Captain Skill of "1". <br><br>
				NOTE: If the target ship has an "Injured Captain" and/or a "Communications Failure" Critical Damage card assigned to it, those cards are flipped face down as well. <br><br>
				OR <br><br>
				<b>ACTION:</b> If Gowron is COVERTLY aboard your ship and your ship is not Cloaked and has no Active Shields, target a friendly ship at Range 1 - 2 that is not Cloaked and has no Active Shields. Gowron is now considered to be aboard that ship. You must adjust the separate sheet of paper to record this change. <br><br>
				NOTE: If this Action is used, Gowron is now considered to be "Openly" aboard the new ship for purposes of End Game scoring. <br><br><br>
				THE GAME ENDS WHEN one player is eliminated or the time limit is reached. <br><br><br>
				<b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
				Destroy all of your opponent's ships.<br><br>
				<b>Bonus:</b> If a player destroys an opponent's ship with Gowron OPENLY aboard, at the end of the game, that player gains +10 Fleet Points. <br><br>
				<b>Bonus:</b> If a player destroys an opponent's ship with Gowron COVERTLY aboard, at the end of the game, that player gains +20 Fleet Points. <br><br><br>

								Will the small creatures cause problems for yourfleet during the battle? Or will they help your ships to achieve victory?<br><br>
								<b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
								<b> Both Players: </b>   130 SP per player.<br><br>
								<b> Map Setup: </b><br>
								* Place the Planet Token directly in the center of the play area. <br>

								TRIBBLES <br><br>
								The Mission Token represents Tribbles. When a Tribble Token is on a Ship Card, it is considered to be aboard that ship. <br><br>
								During the End Phase of each round, add 1 Tribble Token from the pile beside the play area to each ship that already has at least 1 Tribble Token aboard it. <br><br>
								Tribble Tokens affect players' ships as follows: <br><br>
								* While there are 1 or 2 Tribble Tokens aboard a ship, that ship rolls +1 attack die each time it attacks and +1 defense die each time it defends. <br>
								* While there are 3 or 4 Tribble Tokens aboard a ship, there is no effect. <br>
								* While there are 5 or more Tribble Tokens aboard a ship, that ship rolls -1 attack die each time it attacks and -1 defense die each time it defends. <br>
