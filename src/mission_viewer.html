    <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
    The Albino, an Orion Syndicate pirate, has been located operating near Secarus IV. Having had personal dealings with this scum, and endured deep personal losses, you immediately set out to exact your revenge. On arriving, you find that other Klingon ships have also arrived. Your House serves the coldest, best revenge in the Empire - so YOU must be the one to kill the Albino to restore your honor, before the other Houses get to him first.<br><br>
    <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
    <b> Albino Player: </b>    50 SP, must include The Albino as your Captain.<br>
    <b> All Klingon Players: </b>   25 SP each. Each Klingon Player must take Koloth, Kor, or Kang as their Captain, and the Klingon Players may not duplicate unique cards amongst themselves (ie, if Player 2 uses Captain Koloth, Players 3 and 4 are prohibited from using that Captain.)<br><br>
    <b> Map Setup: </b>  Place the Planet Token in the center of the play area. Place 6 Mission Tokens on the Planet Token. Each Player begins in a 4" x 8" area placed at one of the corners of the Play Area.<br><br>

    <b>Four Thousand Throats May Be Cut In One Night By A Running Man:</b>  Remove 1 Mission Token from the Planet Token during each End Phase.<br>
    <b>Pity The Warrior Whose Foes Are All Slain:</b>    Only 1 Klingon Player may win this scenario. Any other Klingon Player loses the game.<br>
    <b>If Winning Is Not Important, Why Keep Score?:</b>   Suggested adjustments to difficulty include changing the number of Mission Tokens that begin the game on the Planet Token, or starting The Albino's Ship within Range 1 of the Planet Token.<br><br>
    <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
    <b>Albino Player Wins:</b>    When the last Mission Token has been removed from the Planet Token, if the Albino Player's Ship is still in play.<br>
    <b>Klingon Player Wins:</b>   The first Klingon Player to destroy the Albino Player's Ship immediately wins the game.<br></font>

      Captain Benjamin Sisko and the crew of Deep Space Nine are protecting Gul Dukat and the ruling council of Cardassia from the Klingons. Your mission is to capture Deep Space Nine before Federation Reinforcements can arrive. Unfortunately, it seems that Deep Space Nine has been secretly upgraded with improved phasers and shields as well as a stockpile of 5000 torpedoes. Heavy losses are expected, but today is a good day to die.<br><br>
      <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
      <b> Player One: </b>    100 SP, all ships must be <img src='img/faction-klingon.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='25' height='25' title='Klingon'> ships with only <img src='img/faction-klingon.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='25' height='25' title='Klingon'> cards equipped to them.<br>

      <b>All Ships Gain The Following Actions:</b><br><br>
      <b>Action:</b>If this ship is within Range 1 of Deep Space Nine and all its Shields have been destroyed: Place any number of Captains, Admirals, and/or <img src='img/stuff/effect_crew.png' style="vertical-align:baseline" width='20' height='20' title='Crew Upgrade'> Upgrades equipped to this ship beside Deep Space Nine.<br><br>
      <b>Action:</b>If this ship is within Range 1 of Deep Space Nine and all its Shields have been destroyed: Equip any number of Captains, Admirals, and/or <img src='img/stuff/effect_crew.png' style="vertical-align:baseline" width='20' height='20' title='Crew Upgrade'> Upgrades beside Deep Space Nine that were equipped to this ship to this ship.<br><br>
      <b>End Phase:</b><br><br>
      1.    Add up the total printed SP of all players' cards beside Deep Space Nine. For each SP above 15, the player with initiative rolls one attack die. If at least 4 <img src='img/stuff/action_battlestations.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Battlestations'> are rolled, the delegation has been captured.<br>
      2.    Deep Space Nine rolls a separate attack vs. each ship at Range 1 - 2. For added difficulty, increase these attacks to Range 1 - 3. For reduced difficulty, decrease these attacks to Range 1.<br>
      3.    Remove one Mission Token from Deep Space Nine.<br><br>
      <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
      <b>Both Players Win:</b>    If the delegation is captured and there are no cards beside Deep Space Nine before the last Mission Token is removed from Deep Space Nine<br></font>

      <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
      A Federation Admiral has gone too far in trying to secure the aid of new allies in the fight against the Dominion and has violated the ideals of the Federation. When confronted about this, the Admiral attempted to place your crew under arrest. Then your would-be "allies" attacked you directly. It falls to you to defend the honor and ideals of the Federation. <br><br>
      <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
      <b> Federation Player: </b>    50 SP including 1 Federation ship.<br>
      <b> Opposing Player: </b>    60 SP including at least 2 ships.<br><br>
      <b> Map Setup: </b>  Place the Planet Token in the center of the map with 3 Mission Tokens on it. Place the Minefield Token centered between the N and S edges of the play area, centered between the Planet Token and the W side of the play area. Place 6 Mission Tokens on the Minefield Token to represent the Collector. The Opposing Player then places the 6 Objective Tokens face down anywhere in the play area, not overlapping any other token in the play area. Players determine initiative and set up order as normal. The Federation Player sets up their ship in a 4" x 16" area centered on the S edge of the play area. The Opposing Player sets up their ships within 4" of the Planet Token, with each ship entirely closer to the N edge of the play area.<br><br>
      <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
      <b>Briar Patch:</b>   When a ship performs a maneuver with a speed greater than 2, that ship takes 1 damage for every point of speed of that maneuver over 2. This damage occurs immediately, before taking any actions. That ship's player may place an <img src='img/stuff/effect_auxilary.png' style="vertical-align:baseline" width='20' height='20' title='AUX Power Token'> Token beside it to reduce this damage by 1. If applied to the ship's Hull, all damage is converted to <img src='img/stuff/effect_crit.png' style="vertical-align:baseline" width='20' height='20' title='Crit Result'>. <br><br>
      <b>Metaphasic Radiation:</b>    All ships may remove 1 <img src='img/stuff/effect_disable.png' style="vertical-align:baseline" width='25' height='20' title='Disabled Token'> Token or 2 <img src='img/stuff/effect_time_token.png' style="vertical-align:baseline" width='25' height='20' title='Time Token'> Tokens instead of 1 from any 1 <img src='img/stuff/effect_crew.png' style="vertical-align:baseline" width='20' height='20' title='Crew Upgrade'> Upgrade, Captain, Admiral, or Elite Talent Upgrade during each End Phase.
      <br><br>
      <b>Metreon Gas Pockets:</b>   If a ship ends its maneuver touching an Objective Token or its maneuver template overlaps an Objective Token, immediately destroy 1 of its Shield Tokens and place an <img src='img/stuff/effect_auxilary.png' style="vertical-align:baseline" width='20' height='20' title='AUX Power Token'> Token beside it before taking any actions.
      <br><br>
      <b>Activating The Collector:</b>    Each End Phase, move 1 Mission Token from the Planet Token to the Minefield Token.
      <br><br>
      <b>Destroying The Collector:</b>    The Minefield Token may be attacked. It does not roll any Defense Dice when attacked. Move 1 Mission Token forom the Minefield Token to the Planet Token for each <img src='img/stuff/effect_hit.png' style="vertical-align:baseline" width='20' height='20' title='Hit Result'> or <img src='img/stuff/effect_crit.png' style="vertical-align:baseline" width='20' height='20' title='Crit Result'> result. If no more Mission Tokens remain on the Minefield Token, it is destroyed (remove the Minefield Token from the Play Area).
      <br><br>
      <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>

      <b> Map Setup: </b>  Place the Planet Token centered 8" from the S and W edges of the play area. Place the Minefield Token touching the N and E edges of the play area (this represents the Bajoran Wormhole). Place the Disabled Federation Ship so that its base is entirely within 4" of the Planet Token. Players determine initiative and set up order for their remaining ships as normal. The Federation player sets up their remaining ships with the rear edge of their bases touching the Minefield Token. The Opposing Player sets up so that their ship bases are entirely within 8" of the Planet Token, but are neither within 4" of the Planet Token, nor within 8" of the Disabled Federation Ship.<br><br>
      <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
      <b>Rescue The Captain! Hurry!:</b>    The Disabled Federation Ship cannot move, be placed, take actions, attack, nor be attacked. During the End Phase, if any other Federation ship is within Range 1 of the Disabled Federation Ship, remove the
      <img src='img/stuff/effect_disable.png' style="vertical-align:center" width='25' height='20' title='Disabled Token'>
      Token from its Ship Card. It is no longer disabled and may then act normally. <br><br>

      they choose who has the Initiative Token next turn. <br><br>
      <b>You Must Escape To Spread The Word - No Trespassing!:</b>    The Opposing Player cannot attack the Disabled Federation Ship, regardless of whether or not a

      <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
      <b>Federation Player:</b>    You win if the Disabled Federation Ship has been rescued and at least 75 SP worth of your fleet escapes to the Alpha Quadrant (including the Disabled Federation Ship).<br>

      Special Components: Planet Token, 10 Mission Tokens <br><br>
      <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
      New intelligence given to the Vulcan High Command shows that the Andorians have recovered a Xindi superweapon, and intend to use it against Vulcan. The Hight Command has sent a large Vulcan fleet to make a preemptive strike against Andoria to prevent this outrage from happening. But the Andorians have sent for reinforcements. If the Vulcan forces has not forced an Andorian surrender before the reinforcements arrive, it is only logical to assume the destruction of the strike force - and of Vulcan as well.  <br><br>
      <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
      <b> Vulcan Player: </b>    100 SP using only <img src='img/faction-vulcan.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='25' height='25' title='Vulcan'> cards. Must include at least 1 D'Kyr-Class ship and 1 Suurok-Class ship.<br>
      <b> Andorian Player: </b>    70 SP. Must not use any <img src='img/faction-vulcan.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='25' height='25' title='Vulcan'> cards. All ships in your fleet must have a hull value of 4 or less.<br><br>
      <b> Map Setup: </b>  Place the Planet Token in the center of the map with the 10 mission tokens on it. Players determine initiative and setup order as normal. The Vulcan Player sets up their fleet within 4" of the N edge of the play area, and the Andorian Player sets up their fleet within 4" of the S edge of the play area.<br><br>
      <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
      <b>Home Field Advantage:</b>    When defending within Range 1 of the Planet Token, all ships in the Andorian Player's fleet modify their Agility value by +1.<br><br>
      <b>Time Is Of The Essence:</b>    At the end of each game round, remove 1 Mission Token from the Planet Token. <br><br>
      Neither player may use a mine upgrade or an upgrade which removes or places their ship from/in the play area.
      <br><br>
      <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
      <b>Vulcan Player:</b>    You win in the End Phase if you have at least 1 ship in the play area and all enemy ships are destroyed. <br>
      <b>Andorian Player:</b>    You win in the End Phase if you have at least 1 ship in the play area, and either: All Mission Tokens have been removed from the Planet Token <b>OR</b> All enemy ships have been destroyed.<br><br>

      <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
      The Dominion fleet seems unstoppable as they attack more and more systems daily. The Federation Alliance has set up a defensive cordon to prevent any more Dominion ships from slipping into Allied territory. But Starfleet has to many commitments for the number of ships available, so the cordon is spread thin. It falls to the battle-tested Nebula-class ships, leading what few hulls are available, to hold the line, and buy time for the Federation Alliance to gear up production for a full-scale war.  <br><br>
      <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
      <b> Player/Team: </b>    130 SP. Your fleet must include the U.S.S. T'Kumbra, with Solok assigned as its Captain.<br>
      <b> Player/Team: </b>    130 SP, minimum of 3 ships.<br><br>
      <b> Map Setup: </b>  The Federation Player/Team sets up their fleet(s) within 8" of the S edge of the play area.<br>
      The Dominion Player/Team sets up their fleet(s) within 4" of the N edge of the play area.<br><br>
      <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
      <b>4-Player Setup:</b>    FEDERATION ALLIANCE TEAM (2 PLAYERS): 130 SP per player. At least on player must include the U.S.S. T'Kumbra, with Solok assigned as its Captain.<br>
      DOMINION TEAM (2 PLAYERS): 130 SP per player, minimum of 3 ships per player.<br><br>
      Players determine initiative and setup order as normal. The Federation Alliance Player/Team sets up their fleet(s) within 8" of the S edge of the play area. The Dominion Player/Team sets up their fleet(s) within 4" of the N edge of the play area.<br><br>
      Neither player may use a mind upgrade or an upgrade which removes or places their ship from/in the play area.
      <br><br>
      <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
      <b>Federation Alliance Player/Team:</b>    You win in the End Phase if you have at least 1 ship in the play area and all remaining Dominion ships are destroyed. <br>
      <b>Dominion Player/Team:</b>    You win immediately if at least half the ships in your fleet(s) rounded up have left the play area through the S edge of the play area.<br><br>
      <b>Note:</b> To adjust the game's difficulty, vary the number of required escaping Dominion ships to 2 or 4. To adjust the 4-player game's difficulty, adjust the number of players per team to 3 vs 1 or 1 vs 3. The solo player in a team game should use the full points and build restrictions of their chosen fleet.

      The Obsidian Order has been guarding the Orias Sector for an unknown, but undoubtedly shady, purpose. It's believed that they are secretly building a fleet without the knowledge of the Central Command.

      <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
      In the Caleb System the Federation has set up an outpost. The Klingon Empire has dispatched ships to destroy this outpost. Commanded by the legendary Kor, the Klingons have a plan to destroy the outpost. Can the Federation defend their outpost or will Kor lead the Klingons to victory?<br><br>

      <b> Klingon Player: </b>     80 SP, including exactly 2 D7 Class ships and 1 "Kor" Captain Card<br><br>
      <b> Map Setup: </b>  The Federation player places all the Objective Tokens in the play area face down. No Objective Token may be within Range 1 of another Objective Token nor within Range 1 of any edge of the play area. Then, the Klingon Player sets up within 4" of any edge of the play area and the Federation player sets up on the edge of the play area opposite of the one the Klingon Player set up on. Then, flip all Objective Tokens face up and place 2 Mission Tokens on each Debris Objective Token.

      <b>Debris:</b> This objective represents previously damaged portions of the outpost that are being repaired. This Objective Token is a ship for the purposes of all rules and has a Primary Weapon Value of 0, an Agility Value of 1, a Hull Value of 2, and a Shield Value of 1. At the beginning of the End Phase, the Federation Player may remove 1 Mission Token from this Objective Token to repair 1 Shield on one of their ships within Range 1.<br><br>

      During a period of strained relations with one of its neighbors, the Romulan Empire has been preparing for war. Any incidents along the Neutral Zone between the two powers could lead to a cataclysm. Naturally, now is the time that a contested planet on the boundary line was invited delegations from each side. Tensions are high, and only a small incident will lead to disaster.

      <b>Romulan Player:</b> Both players should agree upon an appropriate number of Squadron Points.<br>

      <b>Press The Diplomatic Advantage:</b> During each end phase, a Player scores +10 FP if they have more ships within Range 1 of the Planet Token than their opponent, not counting any ships that overlap or are in base contact with the Planet Token. <br><br>
      <b>Hardliners Secret Objectives:</b> At the end of Setup, the Romulan Player selects an unused maneuver dial that has White, Green, and Red Maneuvers. Set the dial to a Maneuver that has a color matching your Secret Objective and place it facedown: <br><br>

      <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
      Rumors of a new planet harboring dilithium crystals reach the ears of the Federation, as well as the Klingon and Romulan Empires. So rich is the new source that it threatens to provoke open war from the Romulan Empire, and even threatens the Khitomer Accords between the Federation and the Klingon Empire.<br><br>
      Each great power sends its closest ship to the planet to discover if the rumors are true, hoping that open war can be averted, but first each side wants to retrieve dilithium samples for analysis. The first ship to reach the planet, secure the samples, and return to its home will be able to lay claim to the discovery.<br><br>
      <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
      <b>Federation Player:</b> 40 squadron points, including at least one Federation Ship and one <img src='img/stuff/effect_crew.png' style="vertical-align:baseline" width='25' height='25' title='Crew Upgrade'> Upgrade. <br>
      <b>Klingon Player:</b> 40 squadron points, including at least one Klingon Ship and one <img src='img/stuff/effect_crew.png' style="vertical-align:baseline" width='25' height='25' title='Crew Upgrade'> Upgrade. <br>
      <b>Romulan Player:</b> 40 squadron points, including at least one Romulan Ship and one <img src='img/stuff/effect_crew.png' style="vertical-align:baseline" width='25' height='25' title='Crew Upgrade'> Upgrade.
      <br><br>
      <b> Map Setup: </b>  The ships are set up as in a standard 3-Player Game (see "3-Player Setup Diagram" on Page 7 of the rulebook). Place the Planet Token in the exact center of the play area and place the 12 Mission Tokens on the table outside of the play area.<br><br>
      <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
      Ships moving through, overlapping, or firing through the Planet Token must obey the rules for the Planet Token outlined on page 26 of the rulebook. <br><br>
      Each ship within Range 1 of the Planet Token gains the following two Actions: <br><br>
      <b>ACTION:</b> If your ship is not Cloaked, disable all of your remaining Shields and then disable your Captain and one Crew Upgrade of your choice (place Disabled Upgrade Tokens on these cards.) These two cards are considered to have beamed down onto the planet as your "Away Team" you cannot remove these Disabled Upgrade Tokens without using the Action listed below. <br><br>
      <b>ACTION:</b> If your ships is not Cloaked, disable all of your remaining Shields to remove the Disabled Upgrade Tokens from your Captain and Crew Upgrade. These two cards are now considered on board the ship and are no longer the "Away Team". <br><br>
      While beamed onto the surface of the planet, an Away Team cannot be targeted by any other cards or effects. While the Captain is part of the Away Team, their ship is considered to have a Skill of 1. <br><br>
      During the End Phase, each ship with an Away Team places 1 Mission Token on top of its Captain Card. Once the Away Team beams back aboard the ship, transfer any Mission Tokens from the Captain Card to their Ship Card. <br><br>
      <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
      Any player that possesses at least 3 Mission Tokens on their Ship Card (not their Captain Card) may enter warp by moving through their starting area and off the play area. This player immediately wins the game. <br><br>
      Any ship that leaves the play area without having 3 Mission Tokens on its Ship Card fails the Mission and loses the game. Also, any ship that leaves the play area without going through its starting area loses the game. <br><br>
      Alternatively, a player can complete the Mission by eliminating all opposing sides.

      The Federation, Klingons, and Romulans are trying to complete a computer program that is contained within secret genetic codes scattered throughout the galaxy. Each Faction races against the other in order to secure the code's knowledge and power, which is no less than the mystery of life itself.<br><br>

      <br><br>
      <b> Map Setup: </b> The ships are set up in one corner of the board. Each ship begins within a 4" x 4" square as its starting area (use Range 1 on the Range Ruler as a way of outlining 4"). The Federation and Klingon starting areas are at the exact center of each side (East and South) and the Romulan ship is in the corner (Southeast). Place 1 Mission Token beside the Romulan ship.<br><br>
      Place 1 Objective Token in each of the corners closest to the Federation and Klingon ships (Southwest and Northeast) and stack 3 Mission Tokens on top of each Objective Token. The Objective Tokens must be placed exactly 8" from both nearby edges.<br><br>
      Place the Planet Token in the corner opposite the Romulan ship (Northwest). Leave exactly 4" between the Planet Token and both nearby edges. <br><br>
      Place all remaining Mission Tokens on the table outside the play area.<br><br>
      <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
      Each Objective Token represents an abstract point in space and does not act as an Obstacle.<br><br>
      Ships moving through, overlapping, or firing through the Planet Token must obey the "Planet Token" rules outlined on page 26 of the rulebook.<br><br>
      <b>Complete The Computer Program</b><br>
      Each ship within Range 1 of an Objective Token gains the following Action: <br><br>
      <b>ACTION:</b> If you are not Cloaked, disable all of your remaining Shields and roll 1 attack die +1 attack die fro each Mission Token beside your ship (see below). If you roll at least 1
      <img src='img/stuff/effect_hit.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Hit Result'> result, you succeed at decrypting one part of the code. If you succeed, remove all Mission Tokens from beside your ship and place 1 Mission Token (from that Objective stack) on top of your Ship Card. If you fail, place a Mission Token <b>from the supply</b> (not from the Objective Token) beside your ship. You may perform this Action once per round, but you cannot attempt to secure more than 1 Mission Token for your Ship Card from the same Objective Token. <br><br>
      Once a Ship Card has acquired 2 Mission Tokens (one from each Objective Token), the ship must travel to the planet to beam down.<br><br>
      Each ship within Range 1 of the Planet Token gains the following Action: <br><br>
      <b>ACTION:</b> If your ship is not Cloaked, disable all of your remaining Shields and then disable your Captain and one Crew Upgrade of your choice (place Disabled Upgrade Tokens on these cards). These two cards are considered to have beamed down onto the planet as your "Away Team". <br><br>
      <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
      The first ship to palce two Mission Tokens on its Ship Card (one from each Objective Token) and then beam its Captain and one Crew Upgrade onto the planet completes the Mission and wins the game. A ship that is destroyed during the same round that its Captain and Crew beam down automatically loses the game. <br><br>
      Alternatively, a player may complete the Mission by eliminating all opposing ships.

An allied fleet including Xindi-Aquatic ships and a Federation ship has arrived to stop this from happening. The Sphere Builders will assist the Xindi-Reptilian and Xindi-Insectoid ships by creating spatial anomalies that will damage or destroy the allied Xindi/Federation fleet. <br><br>
  <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Xindi Player:</b> 120 SP. No ship may have a Hull value greater than 4.<br>
  <b>Allied Player:</b> 160 SP, including at least one Xindi-Aquatic cruiser and one Federation ship. No ship may have a Hull value greater than 6.<br><br>
  <b> Map Setup: </b> Place the Objective Token centered E to W along the N edge of the play area so that it touches the N edge of the play area. Players then set up as in a Standard 2-Player game. Place the Mission Tokens in a stack beside the play area.<br><br>

  A Federation ship uses a captured Xindi shuttle to get past the detection grid around Azati Prime in order to destroy the Xindi Weapon located on the planet. The Federation ship was scanned from a monitoring station on the orbiting moon and to prevent it from sending out a transmission, the station was destroyed. But when contact was lost with the lunar outpost, a squadron of Xindi ships was sent to destroy the Federation ship. <br><br>
  <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Xindi Player:</b> 100 SP, including at least one Xindi-Insectoid starship. No ship may have a Hull value greater than 4.<br>
  <b>Federation Player:</b> 40 SP, including one (and only one) Federation ship.<br><br>
  <b> Map Setup: </b> Place the Planet Token directly in the center of the play area. Place the Objective Token on the S side of the Planet Token, centered E to W so that there is exactly 4" between it and the Planet Token. Place the Mission Tokens in a stack beside the play area.

  <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Azati Prime and Moon:</b> The Planet Token represents Azati Prime and the Objective Token represents the moon that is orbiting the planet. Both are treated as normal Planet Tokens (see pg 23 of the Full Rules of Play). <br><br>
	<b>Squadron Recall:</b> Unbeknownst to the Federation ship, the Xindi shuttle that was sent to destroy the Xindi weapon was itself captured by a Xindi patrol. The captured Federation Captain attempts to negotiate with his captors, but in the meantime, the Xindi squadron is sent out to destroy the Federation ship. <br><br>
	The Mission Tokens represent the passage of time before the Xindi accepts the negotiations and the Xindi ships are recalled. At the end of each End Phase, remove 1 Mission Token from the top of the stack. When there are no more Mission Tokens in the stack, the negotiations are accepted, the Xindi ships are recalled and the game ends. <br><br>
  <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Xindi Player:</b>   You win if you destroy the Federation ship before your ships are recalled.<br><br>
  <b>Federation Player:</b>   You win if the Xindi accept your negotiations (i.e. your ship is not destroyed for 4 rounds). Alternatively, you win if you destory all of the Xindi ships. <br><br><br>
	For a more challenging mission, use 5 or 6 Mission Tokens.

  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
  While on its maiden voyage, and without a full crew, the <i>U.S.S. Enterprise</i> NCC-1701-B reluctantly responds to a distress signal from two Federation transport ships. The distressed ships are trapped in a gravimetric distortion from which they cannot escape and there is little time to save the two ships' crews before they are destroyed by this enerygy distortion ribbon. <br><br>
  <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Federation Player:</b> 40 SP, including one (and only one) ship which must be the <i>U.S.S. Enterprise-B</i>.

  <b> Map Setup: </b> Place 1 Objective Token so that there is exactly 8" between it and the W edge of the play area and exactly 12" between it and the S edge of the play area. Place a 2nd Objective Token so that there is exactly 8" between it and the E edge of the play area and exactly 12" between it and the S edge of the play area. The Federation player then sets up in a 36" x 4" area along the N edge of the play area. Place the 4 Mission Tokens on top of each Objective Token.<br><br>
  <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Transport Ships:</b> The Objective Tokens represent the 2 distressed transport ships. These ships cannot attack, move or perform Actions. They have the following stats: <br>
	Primary Weapon: 0 | Agility: 0 | Hull: 3 | Shields: 0  <br><br>
	<b>Rescuing The Crew:</b> The Mission Tokens represent the crew of the transport ships. You may attempt to rescue the crew by beaming them aboard your ship using one of the following Actions: <br><br>
	<b>ACTION:</b> Disable up to 4 of your remaining Shields and target a ship within Range 2 of your ship. If you have less than 2 Active Shields, remove 1 Mission Token from the target ship and place it on your Ship Card. <br><br>
	<br>ACTION:</b> Disable up to 4 of your remaining Shields and target a ship within Range 1 of your ship. If you have less than 2 Active Shields, remove 2 Mission Tokens from the target ship and place them on your Ship Card. <br><br>
	<b>Energy Ribbon:</b> The energy ribbon which has the transport ships trapped is harmful to any ship within it. At the end of each End Phase, roll 2 attack dice for each of the transport ships and 2 attack dice for your ship if it is within Range 1 of either of the transport ships (or 1 attack die if it is within Range 2 of either of the transport ships).

  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
  <i>"We are the Borg. Lower your shields and surrender your ships. We will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own. Your culture will adapt to service us. Resistance is futile."</i> <br><br>
  <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
	<b>*</b> Each player builds a 120 SP Fleet using the <b>Star Trek: First Contact</b> special rules and the standard Squad Building Rules (on Pg. 21 of the Full rules of Play). <br><br>
	<b>*</b> Place Cube 384 directly in the center of the play area. <br><br>
	<b>*</b> Players set up around the perimeter of the play area within Range 1 of any edge. <br><br>
	<b>*</b> Shuffle the Battle Objective Deck and Borg Attack Deck and place them face down next to the play area. <br><br>
	<b>*</b> Cube 384 starts the game with 30 shields and 30 hull for each player. Mark the total number of shields on the Shield Tracker and the total number of hull on the Hull Tracker. <br><br>
  <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
	<b>ATTACKING:</b> <br><br>
	<b>*</b> Cube 384 makes a number of attacks each turn equal to the number of players. <br><br>
	<b>*</b> Cube 384 attacks using the effect of the Borg Attack Card in play. <br><br>
	<b>*</b> Cube 384 attacks the ships closest to it. <br><br>
	<b>*</b> Cube 384 cannot target the same ship with more than one attack each turn. <br><br>
	<b>*</b> Cube 384's attacks can be cancelled, but any effect that cancels its attack only cancels the attack for the ship that activated the cancelling effect. <br><br>
	<b>*</b> Any ship that cancels an attack of Cube 384 is dealt 2 normal damage. <br><br><br>
	<b>SHIELDS AND HULL:</b>
	<b>*</b> Cube 384 cannot have its shields affected or bypassed by any game effect. <br><br>
	<b>*</b> Cube 384 is not dealt critical damage normally. Instead, when it would be dealt critical damage, it is dealt 2 normal damage. <br><br>
	<b>*</b> Cube 384 is not dalt damge cards. Instead its shields and hull are tracked on its Shield and Hull Trackers. <br><br>
	<b>*</b> Cube 384 repairs 1 damage per player to either its shields or hull at the beginning of each turn. <br><br><br>
	<b>OTHER SPECIAL RULES:</b> <br><br>
	<b>*</b> Cube 384 cannot be moved or placed by any game effect. <br><br>
	<b>*</b> Cube 384 has a Captain Skill of 5. <br><br>
	<b>*</b> Cube 384 cannot be equipped with any Captains, Admirals, Upgrades, or Resources. <br><br>
	<b>*</b> Cube 384 cannot have Auxiliary Power Tokens. <br><br>
	<b>*</b> All ships except for Cube 384 and Sphere 936 are considered to be a part of a single fleet. <br><br>
	<b>*</b> The words ship and ships on this sheet, the Borg Attack Cards, and the Battle Objective cards, refers to all ships and squadrons except for Cube 384 and Sphere 936. <br><br>
	<b>Note - Any effect listed on a Battle Objective Card or Borg Attack Card supersedes all special rules. </b><br><br><br>
	<b>TURN SEQUENCE</b> <br><br>
	At the begining of each turn, before the planning phase, resolve the below steps in order <br><br>
	<b>* Step 1 </b> Overturn the top card of the Battle Objective Deck. This is the Battle Objective Card that will be in play until the end of the turn <br><br>
	<b>* Step 2</b> Shuffle all Borg Attack Cards together. Then, overturn the top card of the Borg Attack Deck. This is the Borg Attack Card that Cube 384 will use to attack during the turn. <br><br>
	<b>* Step 3</b> Activate a Strategic Advantage effect if desired. <br><br>
	<b>* Step 4</b> Cube 384 repairs 1 damage per player to either its shields or hull. <br><br>
	<b>* Step 5</b> Resolve the rest of the turn as normal. <br><br><br>
	<b>BATTLE OBJECTIVE CARDS</b> <br><br>
	Each turn a different Battle Objective Card will be in play. While a Battle Objective Card is in play, the effect listed on the card is active. The players must complete the objective listed on the card by the end of the turn. If they do, they claim the card. If they don't, resolve the repercussions listed on the card and remove the card from the game. If there are no more Battle Objective Cards left in the deck, shuffle together all Battle Objective Cards that have been removed from the game to create a new Battle Objecitve Deck. <br><br><br>
	<b>BORG ATTACK CARDS</b> <br><br>
	At the beginning of each turn shuffle all Borg Attack Cards together (excluding any that have been removed from the game). Then, overturn the top card of the Borg Attack Deck. The overturned card shows the attack Cube 384 will use to attack during the turn. <br><br><br>
	<b>STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE EFFECTS</b> <br><br>
	Once per turn, at the beginning of the turn, after the Battle Objective Card and Borg Attack Card have been revealed for the turn, the players can activate one of the below effects by removing the appropriate amount of claimed Battle Objective Cards from the game. <br><br>
	<b>* 1 Card:</b> Cube 384 cannot repair damage to its shields or hull this turn. <br><br>
	<b>* 2 Cards:</b> Cube 384 takes 10 normal damage. <br><br>
	<b>* 3 Cards:</b> Cube 384 cannot attack this turn. <br><br><br>
	<b>SPHERE 936</b> <br><br>
	When all of Cube 384's shields are destroyed, Sphere 936 is deployed. The players place Sphere 936 touching the base of Cube 384 so that it is perpendicular to an edge of the play area and is facing away from Cube 384. Sphere 936 is treated as a normal ship with the following additional rules; Sphere 936 has a Captain Skill of 5, can only be attacked once per turn, moves using the straight 1 maneuver, cannot take actions, and attacks the ship closest to it. Additionally, when Sphere 936 is deployed, it immediately makes an attack. <br><br>
	If Sphere 936 leave the play area through any edge, it has gone through a temporal vortex and changed the course of history. The players lose the game. <br><br>
	If the players destroy Sphere 936 before it leaves the play area, the crew of the player's ships gain a moral boost which increases the primary weapon value of all ships by +1 for the rest of the game. However, the Borg are now more determined than ever to assimilate your fleet after seeing Sphere 936 get destroyed. Instead of Cube 384 repairing 1 damage per player to either its shields or hull at the beginning of each turn, Cube 384 repairs 2 damage per player to either its shields or hull at the beginning of each turn. <br><br><br>
	<b>WINNING THE GAME</b> <br><br>
	To win the game, players must destroy Cube 384 and Sphere 936 before their fleet is destroyed.

	<b>Federation Player:</b> 30 SP, including one (and only one) Federation ship which must have a Hull Value of 4 or less and must leave 1 Upgrade slot unfilled. <br><br>
  <b> Map Setup: </b> This mission uses a 36" x 60" play area. The Federation ship sets up in an 8" x 36" area along the S edge of the play area. The Romulan ships then set up in the same area, but not within 1 - 3 of the Federation ship.<br><br>

  <img src='img/stuff/effect_hit.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Hit Result'> results, treat this Action as a free Action. <br><br>
  No ship may have any Upgrade deployed to it that allows it to be removed from the play area. <br><br><br>
  <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Romulan Player:</b>   You win if you destroy the Federation ship.<br><br>

  Special Components: 1 Objective Token and 3 Mission Tokens <br><br>
  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
  An entity in the form of an enormous cloud, capable of generating the energy of thousands of starships, has entered into Klingon space. Three Klingon vessels are sent to investigate an unkown entity. <br><br>
  <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Klingon Player:</b> 100 SP, including exactly 3 Klingon ships. At least one of these ships must be a K't'inga Class ship. You must deploy at least 1 Photon Torpedoes Upgrade to each of your ships. You cannot deploy any Upgrades to any of your ships that allow a ship to be removed from the play area or any Upgrades that allow a ship to negate or cancel an entire attack.<br><br>
  <b> Map Setup: </b> Place the Objective Token centered E to W so that it touches the S edge of the play area. The Klingon player then sets up in a 4" x 36" area along the N edge of the play area. Place the 3 Mission Tokens in a stack beside the play area.<br><br>
  <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
  <b>The Entity:</b> The entity is enourmous and the S edge of the play area represents the edge of the cloud. The Objective Token represents a point in the cloud that can be target locked and fired at. The entity does not move and cannot be damaged or affected in any way. <br><br>
  Once it is fired on, at the end of each Combat Phase thereafter, the entity will attack the 2 ships that are closest to the Objective Token. The strength of the attack will vary depending on the distance the ships are away from the Objective Token as follows (to determine Ranges greater than 3, use multiple Range Rulers): <br><br>
  Range 1 - 2 = 12 attack dice, <br>
  Range 3 - 4 = 11 attack dice, <br>
  Range 5 - 6 = 10 attack dice, <br>
  Range  7 - 8 = 9 attack dice, <br>
  Range 9 or higher = 8 attack dice. <br><br>
  <b>Investigate The Unkown Entity:</b> To investigate the entity, you must fire at it with Photon Torpedoes. After a ship fires its torpedoes at the entity, place 1 Mission Token on the attack ship's Ship Card. <br><br><br>
  <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Klingon Player:</b>   You win if you successfully investigate the unkown entity and return at least one of your ships to Klingon space (i.e. exit the play area through your starting area with at least 1 of your ships and have a Mission Token on that ship's Ship Card). <br><br>
  <b>Complete Success:</b> Exit the play area through your starting area with all 3 of your ships and have a Mission Token on each ship's Ship Card. <br><br>
  <b>Partial Success:</b> Exit the play area through your starting area with at least 2 of your ships and have a Mission Token on each of those ship's Ship Cards. <br><br>
  <b>Marginal Success:</b> Exit the play area through your starting area with at least 1 of your ships nad have a Mission Token on that ship's Ship Card. <br><br>

  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
  Most of the Dominion forces have withdrawn from the Chin'toka system, but the system was not left as undefended as the Federation Alliance forces would have believed. The Cardassians have deployed many orbital weapon platforms around each of the planets in the system. Can the Federation Alliance advance ships destroy these weapon platforms? Or will the Cardassian defenses turn back the advancing fleet? <br><br>
  <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Dominion Player:</b> 120 SP, including at least 3 Dominion ships. <br><br>
	<b>Federation Alliance Player:</b> 150 SP, including at least 3 Federation, Romulan, or Klingon ships. One of these ships must be a <i>Saber Class</i> ship. <br><br>
  <b> Map Setup: </b> The Dominion player places the Objective Token anywhere in the play area, but not within Range 2 of any edge of the play area. Players then set up as in a Standard 2-Player game.<br><br>
  <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>

  <b>The Fleet Arrives:</b> The Mission Token represents the passing of time. At the end of each End Phase, remove 1 Mission Token from the stack. When the last Mission Token is removed, the remainder of the Federation fleet has arrived and the game ends. <br><br><br>
  <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Federation Player:</b>   You win if you destroy all of the Dominion ships before the rest of your fleet arrives (i.e. the last Mission Token is removed from the game).<br><br>
  <b>Dominion Player:</b>   You win if you destroy all of the Federation ships. <br><br>

  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
  At the beginning of the Dominion War, the <i>U.S.S. Valiant</i> find itself behind enemy lines and encounters a Cardassian ship near the El-Gatark region. In the battle, both ships are damaged and lose main power. Adrift in space, it is a race against the clock by both ships to attempt to restore power. Whichever ship manages to do this first will gain a decisive advantage. <br><br>
  <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Dominion Player:</b> 40 SP, including one (and only one) Dominion ship. <br><br>
	<b>Federation Player:</b> 40 SP, including one (and only one) <i>Defiant</i>-class ship which must be the <i>U.S.S. Valiant</i>. <br><br>
  <b> Map Setup: </b> Place the Planet Token directly in the center of the play area. Players then set up as in a Standard 2-Player game. Place the 5 Mission Tokens in 2 stacks beside each Ship Card, with a stack of 2 on the left side of each card and a stack of 3 on the right side of each card.<br><br>
  <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Main Power And Weapons:</b> At the start of the game, both ships are considered to be without main power and weapons. The stack of Mission Tokens to the <u>left</u> of each Ship Card represents the time it will take to restore <u>main power</u>. While there are any Mission Tokens in this stack, that ship cannot perform any maneuver with a speed greater than 1. This includes any additional maneuvers gained from Actions or text abilites. <br><br>
  The stack of Mission Tokens to the <u>right</u> of each Ship Card represents the time it will take to restore the <u>ship's weapons</u>. While there are any Mission Tokens in this stack, the ship can only perform attacks with their Primary Weapon as if they had a Primary Weapon value of "1", and cannot perform any attacks with secondary weapons. <br><br>
  During the Activation Phase, as ship may use one of the following Actions: <br><br>
  <b>ACTION:</b> Remove 1 Mission Token from a stack on either side of your Ship Card. <br> <b>OR</b> <br>
  <b>ACTION:</b> Inflict 4 damage to your ship's Hull or Shields and remove 2 Mission Tokens from a stack on either side of your Ship Card. <br><br>
  Once the <u>main power</u> is restored (i.e. there are no more Mission Tokens left in the stack to the <u>left</u> of the Ship Card), that ship may move as normal. <br><br>
  once the <u>ship's weapons</u> are restored (i.e. there are no more Mission Tokens left in the stack to the <u>right</u>of the Ship Card), that ship may attack as normal. <br><br><br>
  <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Federation Player:</b>   You win if you destroy the Dominion player's ship.<br><br>
  <b>Dominion Player:</b>   You win if you destroy the Federation player's ship.

  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
  A Romulan scount vessel has entered into Federation space and is near the planet Galorndon Core. The ship is on a covert mission and a Romulan Warbird, which is still in the Neutral Zone, remains in contact with the scout vessel. A nearby Federation <i>Galaxy</i>-class ship has intercepted a message between the two Romulan ships and has been dispatched to the planet. Will the Romulan scout vessel complete its mission and return to Romulan space with the gathered information? <br><br>
  <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Romulan Player:</b> 70 SP, including one Romulan scout vessel and one other Romulan ship. <br><br>
	<b>Federation Player:</b> 50 SP, including one (and only one) Federation ship. <br><br>
  <b> Map Setup: </b> Place the Planet Token directly in the center of the play area. Place the 4 Objective Tokens so that one Token is to the N, S, E and W of the Planet Token and there is 4" between each Token and the Planet Token. The N and S Tokens are entered E to W and the E and W Tokens are centered N to S. The Romulan player sets up one ship in a 4" x 4" area along the N edge of the player area in the NW corner and the 2nd ship in a 4" x 4" area along the N edge of the play area in the NE corner. The Federation player sets up in a 4" x 4" area, centered E to W along teh S edge of the play area. Place 1 Mission Token on top of each Objective Token.<br><br>
  <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Galorndon Core:</b> The Planet Token represents the planet Galorndon Core. The planet's atmosphere has created severe electromagnetic storms. Any ship that ends its move within Range 1 of the Planet Token must roll 2 attack dice. That ship suffers 1 damage for each

  <b>Covert Mission:</b> The 4 Objective Tokens represent points in space where the Romulan scout vessel must gather the information vital to its mission. The Mission Tokens represent the information that is to be gathered. If the Romulan scout vessel's Ship Base or Maneuver Template overlaps an Objective Token, that ship may perform the following Action: <br><br>
  <b>ACTION:</b> If you Ship's Base or Maneuver Template overlapped an Objective Token this round, remove the Mission Token from on top of that Objective Token and place it on your Ship Card. You cannot perform any free Actions or attack this round. NOTE: Only 1 Mission Token can be gathers from each Objective Token. <br><br>
  <b>Act Of War:</b> If the Federation ship attacks either Romulan ship before the scout vessel has gathered any information, the Federation player has declared an Act of War. If a Romulan ship attacks the Federation ship before the Federation ship attacks either Romulan ship, the Romulan player has declared an Act of War. If a play declares an Act of War, that player immediately loses. <br><br><br>
  <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Romulan Player:</b>   You win if your scout vessel gathers enough information (i.e. has 2 or 3 Mission Tokens on its Ship Card) and exits the play area through the N edge of the play area. Alternatively, you win if you destroy the Federation ship after it has attacked one of your ships.<br>
  COMPLETE SUCCESS: The scout vessel gathers 3 Mission Tokens and exits the play area. <br>
  MARGINAL SUCCESS: The scout vessel gathers 2 Mission Tokens and exits the play area. <br><br>
  <b>Federation Player:</b>   You win if you destroy the Romulan scout vessel after it has collected one or more Mission Tokens. <br>
  COMPLETE SUCCESS: Destroy the scout vessel after it gathers 1 Mission Tokens. <br>
  MARGINAL SUCCESS: Destroy the scout vessel after it gathers 2 - 3 Mission Tokens.

It can be attacked, but it cannot attack, defend or perform Actions, has no shields and has a Hull value of 12. If it is damaged, place all of its damage cards beside the play area. The colony can only suffer the "Minor Explosion", "Console Fire" or "Direct Hit" critical damage cards. Flip any other critical damage cards over immediately and treat them as normal damage. All normal rules apply to the Planet Token (see pg 23 of the Rules of Play).<br><br>

This ship cannot be placed so that it touches another ship's base. It cannot be equipped with any Captain, Admiral or Upgrade Cards and has a Captain SKill Number of 1. The Kazon-Halik player uses this ship as normal. If this ship destroyed, the Kazon-Halik player follows the same process and places another Kazon Raider as above. There is no limit to the number of reinforcement ships.<br><br>
  <b>Federation Ship:</b> At the start of each End Phase, the Kazon-Nistrim player rolls 1 attack die. If the result is a

  A peace treaty between the Federation and the Cardassian Union has recently been established. Believing that the Cardassians have broken this treaty and are arming themselves, Captain Benjamin Maxwell attacked and destroyed a Cardassian outpost in the Cuellar system. Maxwell's unauthorized campaign of vengeance continued as he destroyed 2 Cardassian vessels. The Federation has sent the <i>U.S.S. Enterprise-D</i> to intercept the <i>U.S.S Phoenix</i> and return with them to Starbase 211 before any more damage is done.
  <br><br>
  <!-- Setup -->

  Primary Weapon: 0 | Agility: 0 | Hull: 3 | Shields: 1 <br><br>
  <b>Cardassian Ships:</b> The Cardassian ships have been caught off guard by the attacks and, as such, all of the Cardassian ships' Captains and Upgrades begin the game disabled. At the start of the game, place a Disabled Upgrade Token on each of the Cardassian player's Captain and Upgrade Cards. <br><br>

  A Species 8472 bioship has been severely damaged by an enemy ship. The bioship retreats into an asteroid field, but the enemy ship follows it, confident that it can finish off its prey. Realizing that it might not be able to defeat the enemy vessel with its damaged ship, the bioship's pilot tried a desperate move and exits his ship onto one of the asteroids to face the enemy captain and make a final stand.

  <b>Enemy Player:</b> 60 SP, including one (and only one) non-Borg ship.<br><br>
  <!-- Map Setup -->
  <b>Map Setup:</b> Starting with the Species 8472 player, both players alternate placing 1 Objective Token anywhere in the play area. Once all of the Objective Tokens have been placed, playes continue to alternate and place the 6 Mission Tokens anywhere in the play area (for a more challenging game use 8, 10, or 12 Mission Tokens). No Token may be placed within 4" of another Token or any edge of the play area. Players then set up as in a Standard 2-Player game.<br><br>
  <!-- Special Rules -->
  <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Damaged Ship:</b> The Species 8472 Bioship begings the game with no Shields remaining and 1 Damage to its Hull. In addition, all of its Upgrades begin the game disabled. At the start of the game, place a Disabled Upgrade Token on each of its Upgrades. <br><br>
  <b>Asteroid Field:</b> The Objective Token and the Mission Tokens represent asteroids of 2 different sizes. Treat these as Obstacles (see pg 22 of the Rules of Play). In addition, if a ship is within Range 1 of one of the larger asteroids (i.e. the Objectve Tokens) that ship may send an Away Team to that asteroid by using the following Action: <br><br>
  ACTION: Disable all of your remaining Shields and place a Disabled Upgrade Token on your Captain Card and/or any number of your
  <img src='img/stuff/effect_crew.png' style="vertical-align:baseline" width='20' height='20' title='Crew Upgrade'> Upgrades. These cards are now considered a part of your Away Team. NOTE: This Action cannot be used until the 5th round of play. <br><br>
  <b>Battle On The Asteroid:</b> Once the Species 8472 ship has an Away Team, that ship cannot move, perform Actions or be attacked for the remainder of the game. Once both players have an Away Team on the same asteroid, the space battle ends and the battle on the asteroid begins. Players attack each other simultaneously. The Away Team with the higher Skill rolls 1 extra die (attack or defense). The enemy player rolls 1 attack die and 1 defense die for his/her Captain Card and for each
  <img src='img/stuff/effect_crew.png' style="vertical-align:baseline" width='20' height='20' title='Crew Upgrade'> Upgrade in his Away Team. The Species 8472 player rolls 2 attack dice and 2 defense dice for his Away Team. Any

  <img src='img/stuff/effect_crit.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Crit Result'> results in damage to the opposing Away Team. Each card in the Away Team requires 1 damage to destroy it. NOTE: The Species 8472 player's Away Team may use the "Biogenic Field" and/or the "Biological Technology" Upgrades if those Upgrades were assigned to his ship and were not disabled when the Away Team was send to the asteroid. Any Mission Tokens that were on the "Biological Technology" Upgrade at that time remain in effect. In addition, the Bioship Beta Pilot may use his re-roll ability during this battle.

    While journeying to Earth to deliver his nephew Nog to Starfleet Academy, Quark has decided to make his trip more profitable by smuggling a shipment of kemocite at the same time, which is in direct violation of Federation law. Unbeknownst to Quark, the Ferengi shuttle that was given to him by his cousin as repayment of a debt was sabotaged and the trip has become much more difficult than he planned for.
  <br><br>
  <!-- Setup -->
  <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
  <!-- Player 1 -->
  <b>Feregni Player:</b> 60 SP, including the Ferengi shuttle, Quark's Treasure, which must have Quark assigned as its Captain and Rom and Nog assigned as <img src='img/stuff/effect_crew.png' style="vertical-align:baseline" width='20' height='20' title='Crew Upgrade'> Upgrades, and 1 other ship with a Hull value of 4 or greater.

  <b>Federation Player:</b> 45 SP, including one (and only one) Federation ship. <br><br>
  <!-- Map Setup -->
  <b>Map Setup:</b> Place the Planet Token in the play area with exactly 4" between it and the S and E edges of the play area. The Federation player sets up in a 36" by 4" area along the S edge of the play area. The Ferengi player then sets up Quark's Treasure in a 4" x 4" area in the NW corner of the play area and then sets up the other ship anywhere within Range 1 of the Planet Token, but not within Range 1 of any edge of the play area.<br><br>
  <!-- Special Rules -->
  <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Starfleet Academy:</b> If the Quark's Treasure is within Range 1-2 of the Planet Token it may deliver Nog to Starfleet Academy by using the following Action: <br>
  ACTION: Disable all of your remaining Shields and remove the Nog <img src='img/stuff/effect_crew.png' style="vertical-align:baseline" width='20' height='20' title='Crew Upgrade'> Upgrade from the game. Place 1 Mission Token on your Ship Card. <br>
  NOTE: The Nog <img src='img/stuff/effect_crew.png' style="vertical-align:baseline" width='20' height='20' title='Crew Upgrade'> Upgrade cannot be affected by the Federation ship unless it is still on the Quark's Treasure after the Kemocite is transferred (see below). <br><br>
  <b>Transferring the Kemocite:</b> If the Quark's Treasure is docked on the Ferengi Player's other ship, it may use its Action or the docking ship's Action to transfer the Kemocite to the docking ship. Other cards may be exchanged as per the normal exchange rules during this Action as well. Place 1 Mission Token on the Quark's Treasure Ship Card if this occurs. <br><br>
  <b>Violating Federation Law:</b> The Federation ship cannot attack the Ferengi player's ships until after they have violated Federation law (i.e. the kemocite has been transferred) <br><br>
  <b>Sabotage:</b> Each Activation Phase, before the Quark's Treasure moves, roll 1 attack die. If you roll a

  result, add 2 to the speed of the Quark's Treasure's maneuver. If this happens, treat it as a red maneuver. You may disable the Rom 
  <img src='img/stuff/effect_crew.png' style="vertical-align:baseline" width='20' height='20' title='Crew Upgrade'> Upgrade to cancel this effect. If you roll a blank result, there is not sabotage and you do not have to make this roll again for the remainder of the game.

  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
    In 2290, during the Federation-Klingon war, the I.K.S. T'Ong left the Klingon empire on a long-range mission to attack a distant Federation outpost and placed their crew in a cryogenic stasis. 75 years later, after the war has long been over, the crew of the T'Ong awakens and heads for the outpost. The Federation has sent a nearby ship to intercept them before they can carry out their mission.

  <!-- Player 1 -->
  <b>Klingon Player:</b> 40 SP, including one (and only one) K't'inga-class ship. The Cryogenic Stasis Upgrade Card must be deployed to this ship.
  <br><br>
  <!-- Player 2 -->
  <b>Federation Player:</b> 60 SP, including one (and only one) Federation ship. <br><br>
  <!-- Map Setup -->
  <b>Map Setup:</b> Place the Objective Token centered E to W so that there is exactly 4" between it and the S edge of the play area. The Klingon Player sets up in a 36" x 4" area along the N edge of the play area and the Federation Player sets up in a 36" x 12" area along the S edge of the play area.<br><br>
  <!-- Special Rules -->

  <b> Federation Outpost:</b> The Objective Token represents the Federation Outpost. The Outpost cannot move, perform Actions of attack and has the following stats: HULL: 4 | SHIELDS: 2 <br><br>
  <b>Emissary:</b> If the Federation ship is in a position to attack the Klingon ship with its Primary Weapon or one of it's Secondary Weapons (i.e. within Range and the Klingon ship is in one of its usable firing arcs), that ship may attempt to convince the Klingon ship to stand down. If it does so, the Federation ship foregoes its attack and places 1 Mission Token on its Ship Card. <br>
  During the End Phase, if there are 3 Mission Tokens on the Federation Ship Card, the emissary has successfully convinced the Klingon ship to stand down and the game ends. If there are 1 or 2 Mission Tokens on the Federation Ship Card, the Federation ship rolls 1 attack die for each Mission Token on its Ship Card. If at least 1 CRTI result is rolled, the emissary has successfully convinced the Klingon ship to stand down and the game ends. Otherwise, the game continues. <br>
  If the Federation ship attacks the Klingon ship, remove all Mission Tokens from the Federation Ship Card.
  <br><br><br>

  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
With the help of a fellow Romulan ship, a Romulan Valdore-class ship has joined forces with a Federation ship to engage a powerful enemy ship in the area of space between Romulus and the Romulan Neutral Zone known as the Bassen Rift. Armed with a highly advanced cloaking device and a deadly Thalaron weapon, the enemy vessel is bent on the genocide of humanity.  <br><br>

  <b>Enemy Ship:</b> The Enemy Player's ship has the following special abilities: 
<br><br>
1) Add the icon to your Action Bar if it's not already there. 

<br><br>

2) When cloaked, you may use a 1, 2 or 3 ↑ Maneuver Template when performing the Action and you may choose to place an Auxiliary Power Token beside your ship to keep your Token from flipping to its red side. 

<br><br>

3) Once per game when attacking an enemy ship, you may perform a 10 dice attack against that ship. Instead of inflicting normal damage for that attack, for each uncancelled ✦ or result, discard the Captain Card or 1 Upgrade (opponent's choice) on the target ship. If the Captain and all of the Ugrades on the target ship are destroyed, any additional uncancelled results damage the ship as normal (max 5 damage).

<br><br>
 4) When attacking with your Primary Weapon, during the Modify Attack Dice step, you may re-roll one of your blank results. 

<br><br>

5) Each round, you may perform 1 of the Actions on your Action Bar as a free Action.

  <!-- Mission Overiew -->
  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
A Federation ship followed the coordinates, from what they believed to be an encrypted transmission from Starfleet and have encountered the U.S.S. Dauntless. The encoded message was decrypted by an alien passenger on board their ship, Arturis, who turned out to be the last of his race, designated Species 116 by the Borg, and lured the Federation ship into his trap. He blames the Federation for the assimilation of his race and has vowed his revenge. He created the ship and disguised it using particle synthesis to appear as the Dauntless, hoping to lure the entire crew of the Federation ship on board and take them straight into Borg space to be assimilated. The Federation crew has uncovered his plan, so Arturis settled for kidnapping a few of the members of the Federation crew. Can they stop him before he reaches Borg space?
  <br><br>
  <!-- Setup -->
  <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
  <!-- Player 1 -->
  <b>Federation Player:</b> 45 Squadron Points, including one (and only one) Federation ship with a Hull value of 4 or less. You must deploy at least 2 Upgrades to your ship, and you cannot deploy any Upgrades with a cost greater than 5 SP. 
  <br><br>
  <!-- Player 2 -->
  <b>Independent Player:</b> 45 Squadron Points, including one (and only one) ship which must be the U.S.S. Dauntless and must have Arturis as its Captain.
<br><br>
  <!-- Map Setup -->
  <b>Map Setup:</b> This mission uses a 36" x 60" play area. Place 1 Objective Token centered E to W so that it touches the S edge of the play area. Place the 2nd Objective Token centered E to W so that it touches the N edge of the play area. The Federation player sets up in a 36" x 4" area along the N edge of the play area. The Independent player then sets up anywhere within Range 1-2 of the Federation ship. Place the Mission Tokens beside the play area. 
<br><br>
  <!-- Special Rules -->
  <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Kidnapped Crew:</b> At the beginning of the game, during Set Up, the Federation player must flip face down either his Captain Card and 1 of his Upgrades OR 2 of his Upgrades. The face down cards must have a combined total of at least 7 SP. These cards are considered to be onboard the U.S.S. Dauntless and cannot be used until they are rescued (i.e. flipped face up). 
<br><br>
  <b>Rescuing Your Crew:</b> If the Federation ship is within Range 1-2 of the U.S.S. Dauntless, and the Dauntless has no Active Shields, instead of using its normal Action, the Federation ship may perform the following Action: 
<br><br>

ACTION: If your ship is not cloaked, disable all of your remaining Shields and flip one of your face down cards (see above) face up. This card is now considered onboard your ship and is usable by your ship. 

<br><br>
 <b>Quantum Slipstream Drive:</b> As both ships are considered to be using a quantum slipstream drive, the "Quantum Slipstream Drive" Upgrade cannot be used for this mission. 
<br><br>
<b>Entering Borg Space:</b> In this mission, the ships will be exiting the play area through the S edge and re-entering the play area through the N edge up to 3 times. As such, you will need some extra space beyond the S edge of the play area. When a ship exits the play area through the S edge, finish the move and mark its position relative to the Objective Token. Then place that ship back in the play area using the same relative position to the N Objective Token.
<br>
<i>Example: A ship exits the play area and there is 4" between it and the S Objective Token and 12" between it and the Wedge of the play area. That ship is removed from the table and immediately placed back in the play area so that there is 4" between it and the N Objective Token and 12" between it and the W edge of the play area. The facing of the ship remains the same. That ship then removes 1 Mission Token from the stack and places it on its Ship Card. If a ship exits the play area when there are no Mission Tokens left in the stack, that ship has entered Borg Space and the game ends immediately.</i>
<br><br>
<b>Non-Lethal Attacks:</b> When attacking, during the Roll Attack Dice step, the attacking ship may choose to roll up to 3 less attack dice, and/or during the Deal Damage step, the attacking ship may choose to reduce the amount of damage it inflicts on the other ship by any amount. 
<br>
NOTE: If at least 1 damage is reduced in this way during the Deal Damage step, place an Auxiliary Power Token beside the attacking ship. 
  <br><br><br>
  <!-- Objectives -->
  <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Federation Player:</b> You win if you rescue all of your kidnapped crewmembers before the Dauntless enters Borg Space and then exit the play area OR if you destroy the U.S.S. Dauntless after you have rescued all of your kidnapped crew.
 <br><br>
  <b>Independent Player:</b> You win if you enter Borg Space with at least 1 kidnapped crewmember (i.e. the Federation Player still has at least 1 face down card) OR if you destroy the Federation ship after all of the kidnapped crew has been rescued.

  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
During a battle simulation being held in the Braslota system, two Federation starships find themselves suddenly under attack by a Ferengi D'Kora-class Marauder. The Federation ships do not have any weapons systems at the ready, as they were rendered inoperable for the simulation, and so they are not prepared to make a stand with the Ferengi ship. Can the Federation ships prevent their destruction in time to ready their weapons and do battle with the Ferengi? Or will the Marauder claim the two vulnerable ships as its prizes?

  <!-- Map Setup -->
  <b>Map Setup:</b> Place the Planet Token directly in the center of the play area. The Federation Player sets up both of his ships within Range 1 of the Planet Token, but not within Range 1 of each other. In addition, the Federation ships cannot face the N edge of the play area (i.e. the front edge of their ship bases must be, at the very least, perpendicular to the N edge). The Ferengi ship then sets up in a 36" x 4" area along the S edge of the play area. Place the 12 Mission Tokens in a stack beside the Federation Ship Cards.
<br><br>
  <!-- Special Rules -->
  <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Battle Simulation:</b> The two Federation ships are performing a battle simulation and have rendered their weapons inoperable. The Mission Tokens represent the amount of time that the Federation weapons are unusable. While there are any Mission Tokens in the stack, the Federation ships cannot perform any attack, including attacks that occur outside of the Combat Phase. At the end of each round, after the End Phase, remove from the game 1 Mission Token from the stack. When there are no more Mission Tokens in the stack, the Federation weapons are ready to use, and the Federation ships may then attack. 
<br><br>

<b>Readying Weapons:</b> During the Activation Phase, the Federation ships may perform the following Action: 

<br><br>

ACTION: Remove one Mission Token from the stack beside the Federation Ship Cards. If your ship performed a White Maneuver this round, place an Auxiliary Power Token beside your ship. 

 <br><br><br>
  <!-- Objectives -->
  <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Ferengi Player:</b> You win if you destroy both of the Federation ships OR if you destroy one of the Federation ships and then exit the play area through your starting area after the Federation ships' weapons become operable (i.e. the last Mission Token is removed from the stack). 
 <br><br>
  <b>Federation Player:</b> You win if you destroy the Ferengi ship.

  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
A Federation Captain finds himself travelling between three different timelines and has discovered a spatial anomaly in the Devron system that turns out to be an anti-time eruption. He learns that this anti-time eruption will the cause entire human race to be destroyed unless he can figure out a way to collapse the anomaly. He has concluded that if his three ships from the three different timelines converge in the center of the anomaly and initiate static warp shells, an artificial subspace barrier will be created and the anomaly will collapse. The Devron system is controlled by the Klingon Empire in this timeline and they have refused access to their space and sent warships to destroy the trespassing ship. Can the static warp shell be intiated in time?

His 2nd ship is placed on top of its Ship Card. Place 6 Mission Tokens in a stack beside the play area and place 3 Mission Tokens on top of each of the Mirror Universe Player's Ship Cards.
<br><br>
  <!-- Special Rules -->
  <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Anomaly:</b> The Objective Token represents the center of the spatial anomaly and is treated as just a point in space. Any ship that is within Range 1-2 of the Objective Token cannot be target locked and cannot perform the Action. 
<br><br>

<b>Limited Time:</b> At the end of each End Phase, remove from the game 1 Mission Token from the stack beside the play area. When there are no Mission Tokens left in this stack, the game is over. 

<br><br>

<b>Delayed Ship:</b>  After the first round is completed, at the start of the Planning Phase, the Mirror Universe Player sets up his 2nd ship in his starting area and may now use that ship. 

<br><br>

<b>Static Warp Shell:</b> If a Mirror Universe/Federation ship has any Mission Tokens on its Ship Card and is within Range 1 of the Objective Token, instead of performing its normal Action, it may perform the following Action:

<br><br>

ACTION: Remove 1 Mission Token from your Ship Card and place it on top of the Objective Token. During the End Phase, if at least one of the Mirror Universe Player's ships has no Mission Tokens on its Ship Card, that ship has initiated a static warp shell and collapsed the anomaly. 

 <br><br><br>

  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
 A prototype Federation starship has been hijacked by a group of Romulans and has rendezvoused with a small fleet of Romulan ships. A group of Federation ships have encountered them in an attempt to regain control of their stolen ship. Unbeknownst to the Romulans, an Emergency Medical Hologram has transported onto the stolen ship and, working with that ship's EMH, is attempting to subdue the hijackers and retake the ship.

<br><br>
  <!-- Setup -->
  <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
  <!-- Player 1 -->
  <b>Romulan Player:</b> 120 Squadron Points, including one (and only one) Prometheus class ship. At least 40 SP of the 120 SP must be assigned to the Prometheus class ship and Rekar must be assigned as its Captain. The Romulan player cannot deploy The Doctor or the EMH Mark II Upgrade to any ship in his fleet. 
  <br><br>
  <!-- Player 2 -->
  <b>Federation Player:</b> 90 Squadron Points, which cannot include a Prometheus class ship. In addition, the Federation fleet cannot have The Doctor or the EMH Mark II assigned to any of its ships.

  <!-- Map Setup -->
  <b>Map Setup:</b> Place the 4 Mission Tokens in a stack beside the play area. Players then set up as in a Standard 2-Player game. 
<br><br>
  <!-- Special Rules -->
  <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Hijacked Ship:</b> At the start of the game, the Prometheus class ship is in control of the Romulan player. The Romulan player may move, perform Actions and attack with the ship as normal. 
<br><br>

<b>Regaining Control Of The Hijacked Ship:</b> At the end of each End Phase, take 1 of the Mission Tokens from the stack beside the play area and remove it the game. At the start of the Planning Phase, if there are no Mission Tokens left in the stack (i.e. they have all been removed from the game), the Federation player assumes control of the Prometheus class ship. The Federation player then moves, performs Actions and attacks with the ship. 

<br><br>

When control of the Prometheus class ship switches to the Federation player, discard any Romulan cards (Captains, Admirals, or Upgrades) that are assigned to ship. The Federation player then assigns "The Doctor" as its new Captain and deploys the "EMH Mark II" Upgrade to the ship. All ships in the fleet that controls the Prometheus class ship are considered friendly ships and all ships in the other fleet are considered enemy ships. 

 <br><br><br>

  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
The Bajoran extremist faction known as the Alliance for Global Unity, secretly backed by the Cardassians, has sent a fleet of ships to take over control of Deep Space 9 from the Federation. All of the non- military personnel have evacuated the space station before their arrival, but all of the Federation personnel has remained on the station to delay the takeover for as long as possible.

<br><br>
  <!-- Setup -->
  <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
  <!-- Player 1 -->
  <b>Federation Player:</b> 30 SP, including one (and only one) Federation ship with a Hull value of 3 or less. 
  <br><br>
  <!-- Player 2 -->
  <b>Bajoran Player: </b> 90 SP, including at least one Bajoran scout ship. All ships in the Bajoran player's fleet must have a Hull value of 3 or less and have a Bajoran Captain assigned to them. In addition, only Upgrades may be assigned to the Bajoran player's ships.
<br><br>
  <!-- Map Setup -->
  <b>Map Setup:</b> Place the Planet Token directly in the center of the play area. Place the Objective Token centered from E to W with exactly 4" between it and the N edge of the play area. This represents the space station, Deep Space 9. Place the 1 of the Mission Tokens on top of the Objective Token and place the remaining Mission Tokens in a stack beside the 2 play area. Players then set up as in a Standard 2-Player game. 
<br><br>
  <!-- Special Rules -->
  <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
  <b>Federation Personnel:</b> At the end of every End Phase, take 1 of the Mission Tokens from the stack beside the play area and place it on top of the Objective Token. The represents the Federation personnel on the space station preparing for the siege. 
<br><br>

<b>Docking At The Space Station:</b> During any Activation Phase after the first game round, the Bajoran ships may perform the following Action if they are within Range 1 of the space station: ACTION: Disable your Captain and all of your Upgrades. These cards are now considered to be a part of your Away Team. Once a card is part of an Away Team, it cannot return to its ship and it cannot be targeted by the enemy ship. NOTE: A ship that performs this Action cannot move, perform Actions or attack, and remains where it is for the rest of the game. It is now considered to be "docked" at the space station. 

<br><br>

<b>Taking Control Of The Space Station:</b> Once all of the Bajoran player's remaining ships have docked at the space station, the battle in space ends and both players now attempt to capture all of their opponents forces and take control of the station. 

<br><br>

<b>Capturing The Enemy Forces:</b> The Bajoran player rolls a number of attack and defense dice equal to the 3 number of cards in his Away Team. The Federation player rolls a number of attack and defense dice equal to the number of Mission Tokens on the Objective Token. Both players compare the results of these rolls simultaneously. For each uncancelled

or
<img src='img/stuff/effect_crit.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Crit Result'>
result rolled by the Bajoran player, take 1 Mission Token from on top of the Objective Token and remove it from the game. For each un-cancelled

<img src='img/stuff/effect_crit.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Crit Result'>
result rolled by the Federation player, remove 1 card from the Away Team from the game. Repeat this process until there are either no Mission Tokens and/or no cards left in the Away Team. Once either of these things happen, the mission is over.

 <br><br><br>
  <!-- Objectives -->
  <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>

<b>Bajoran Player:</b> You win if you capture all of the Federation personnel on the space station <br> 
(i.e. all of the Mission Tokens have been removed from the game).
 <br><br>
<b>Federation Player:</b> You win if you capture all of the Bajoran Away Team <br>
(i.e. there are no cards left in the Bajoran player's Away Team).
<br><br>
If the last of the Mission Tokens and the last of the Away Team cards are removed at the same time, the player who started the takeover rolls with the fewest (tokens or cards) wins.

  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
Returning after a raid on the Dominion Outpost at Trelka V, the Klingon raiding ships find themselves being pursued by a larger number of Dominion ships bent on retaliation. It is doubtful that the Klingon raiding ships can outrun them. In order to regain lost honor, one Klingon Bird-of-Prey will attempt to stop them, no matter the cost, to allow the others the time needed to reach the rendezvous point.

<br><br>

- The Klingon ship may never receive an Auxiliary Power Token. If an ability requires one to be placed beside the Klingon ship, disregard that requirement. 

<br><br>

- When defending, the Klingon ship rolls an additional +2 defense dice.

  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
Krenim military temporal scientist, Annorax, has created a weapon ship capable of causing temporal incursions that could eliminate entire species. In his first attack with the weapon ship, he was able to erase the Rilnar people from existence. The causality paradox created by this incursion caused fifty million of his own Krenim people to be killed by disease, including Annorax's wife. For hundreds of years Annorax has attempted to undo this mistake, and he believes that each incursion will bring this closer. A Federation ship is trying to stop his latest attempt.

<br><br>
  <!-- Setup -->

  <!-- Player 1 -->
  <b>Federation Player:</b> 80 SP, including at least one Federation ship.

<br><br>
  <!-- Player 2 -->
  <b>Krenim Player: </b> 80 SP, including at least one Krenim Weapon Ship with Annorax assigned as its Captain and the "Temporal Incursion" Upgrade deployed to it. 

<br><br>
  <!-- Map Setup -->
  <b>Map Setup:</b> Place the Planet Token directly in the center of the play area. Players then set up as in a Standard 2-Player game. Place the 12 Mission Tokens on top of the "Temporal Incursion" Upgrade card.
<br><br>
  <!-- Special Rules -->
  <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
<b>Temporal Incursion:</b> While there are still any Mission Tokens left on top of the "Temporal Incursion" Upgrade, it remains deployed to the Krenim Weapon Ship, and cannot be discarded.

<br><br>
Each round, instead of making a normal attack, the Krenim player may choose to attack the Planet Token with his Krenim Weapon Ship. In order to do this, the "Temporal Incursion" Upgrade must still be deployed to his ship, AND the Planet Token must be within Range 1 of the Krenim Weapon Ship and in its forward firing arc. NOTE: When attacking the planet, the "Temporal Incursion" Upgrade is only disabled (not discarded) and does not require a target lock.
If there is at least one
<img src='img/stuff/effect_hit.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Hit Result'> result made with this attack, remove 1 Mission Token from on top of the "Temporal Incursion" Upgrade and place it on the Planet Token. In addition, if there is at least one
<img src='img/stuff/effect_crit.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Crit Result'> result made with this attack, remove 2 Mission Tokens from on top of the "Temporal Incursion" Upgrade and place them on the Planet Token. At any time, if there are at least 7 Mission Tokens on the Planet Token, the planet is "erased" from history. 

<br><br>

Remove 1 of the Mission Tokens on top of the "Temporal Incursion" Upgrade from the game:

<br><br>
1) Each time the attack on the "Temporal Incursion" Upgrade is used against a Federation ship, 
<br>
2) Each time a Federation card would cause the "Temporal Incursion" Upgrade to be discarded.
<br>
OR
<br>
3) Each time the planet is attacked and no

While on a course to rendezvous with another ship in its assault fleet, a Terran NX class ship is attacked by a small band of rebel ships. The NX class ship's captain was killed in the ambush and Admiral Black has taken command. Though it is outgunned and outnumbered, Black and his crew are still holding their own while attempting to escape the rebel ships' pursuit. Can the NX class ship reach the assault fleet in time?

The Terran player then sets up his NX class ship in a 4" x 4" area centered along the S edge of the play area and his reinforcement ship in a 36" x 4" area along the N edge of the play area.
<br><br>
  <!-- Special Rules -->
  <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
<b>Evasive Maneuvers:</b> In this mission, the Enemy ships are in pursuit of the NX class ship. At the end of each Activation Phase, if the NX class ship has not yet rendezvoused with the reinforcement ship, place a number of Tokens beside the NX class ship equal to 1, plus 1 for each Enemy ship that has the NX class ship in its forward firing arc (or 360° firing arc). In addition, if the NX class ship has at least one of the Enemy ships in its forward firing arc, place 1 Token beside the Terran ship.

<br><br>

<b>Rendezvous:</b> To make the rendezvous, the Terran ship must end its move within Range 1-3 of the Objective Token. Once the rendezvous is made, the Terran player may use the reinforcement ship as normal (starting in the Combat Phase of the round in which the rendezvous occurs). Until the rendezvous is made, the reinforcement ship remains out of play (i.e. it cannot affect anything in the play area), unless it is attacked or affected by an 3 Enemy ship.

  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
Responding to a message from the Federation colony on the planet Cestus III, a Federation starship beams a landing party down to the planet. The away team finds the colony destroyed and quickly learns that the message was a fake intended to lure them into an ambush. Before they can react, the away team is attacked by a Gorn raiding party, but using the weapons found on the planet, the landing party manages to thwart the ambush, and attempts to return to their ship to finish the battle in space.

<br><br>
  <!-- Setup -->
  <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
  <!-- Player 1 -->
  <b>Federation Player:</b> 45 SP, including one (and only one) Federation ship equipped with exactly 2 Upgrades.

<br><br>
  <!-- Player 2 -->
  <b>Gorn Player:</b> 45 SP, including one (and only one) Gorn Raider.

<br><br>

  <!-- Map Setup -->
  <b>Map Setup:</b> Place the Planet Token centered E to W with exactly 4" between it and the S edge of the play area. The Federation player sets up in a 4" x 4" area to the N side of the Planet Token and centered E to W so that the S edge of the starting area touches the N side of the Planet Token. The Gorn player then sets up in a 12" x 4" area centered along the S edge of the play area.
<br><br>
  <!-- Special Rules -->
  <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
<b>Away Team:</b> At the start of the game, the Federation player places a Mission Token on his Captain card and both of his Upgrade cards and places them away from his Ship Card. These cards are considered the Federation player's Away Team which is being attacked on the planet's surface. While on the Away Team, these cards cannot be used for their text abilities and cannot affect or be affected by either ship in any way.
<br><br>
If the Federation ship is within Range 1-2 of the Planet Token, it may use the following Action:
<br><br>
<b>ACTION:</b> Declare any number of your Away Team cards that will attempt to return to your ship. The Gorn player rolls a number of attack dice equal to 1 plus the number of cards declared with this Action. The Federation player then rolls a number of defense dice equal to 4 minus the number of cards declared with this Action. Subtract the number of uncancelled or results from the declared number of cards. The result is the number of Mission Tokens removed from Away Team cards (min 0).
<br><br>
<i>For example: The Federation player declares that 2 of his Away Team members will attempt to return to the ship. The Gorn player rolls 3 attack dice (1+2 for the declared cards) and rolls 2+ results. The Federation player then rolls 2 defense dice (4-2 for the declared cards) and rolls 1 result. There is 1 uncancelled ✦ result, so 1 Mission Token is removed. </i>
<br><br>
At the end of the Activation Phase, all of the Away Team cards that no longer have a Mission Token on them are returned to the Federation player's ship.

 <br><br><br>
  <!-- Objectives -->
  <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>

<b>Gorn Player:</b> You win if you destroy the Federation ship while the Federation player still has one or more cards in his Away Team OR if you exit the play area (through the N edge of the play area) after all of the Federation player's Away Team has returned to his ship

<br><br>

<b>Federation Player:</b> You win if you destroy the Gorn ship after all of your Away Team has returned to your ship.

  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
The Federation has intercepted a number of coded messages from Celtris III, a planet in Cardassian space. They believe that a fleet is being amassed to invade the planet Minos Korva near the Cardassian border. A single Federation ship was sent to initiate peace talks with the Cardassians and though the talks were not successful, the Federation ship discovered that the Cardassian fleet is laying in wait in the McCallister C-5 Nebula to ambush the Federation ships. The nebula is a protostellar nebula, so even though the high levels of particle flux in the nebula prevent them from being scanned, ships cannot stay in there for long as it damages their hulls.

<br><br>

  <!-- Map Setup -->
  <b>Map Setup:</b> Place 1 Mission Token so that it touches the outside of the W edge of the play area and there is exactly 12" between it and the S edge of the play area. Then place 1 Mission Token so that it touches the outside of the E edge of the play area and there is exactly 12" between it and the S edge of the play area. The imaginary line between the center of these tokens represents the S edge of the nebula. The Federation player sets up in a 4" x 36" area along the S edge of the play area and then the Cardassian player sets up in a 24" x 36" area along the N edge of the play area.
<br><br>
  <!-- Special Rules -->
  <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
<b>Nebula:</b> The Cardassian fleet begins the game in the nebula. A ship in the McCallister C-5 Nebula:
<br><br>
1) Rolls +1 defense die when attacked at Range 3, despite the presence of an opposing ship's <img src='img/stuff/action_scan.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Scan'> Token.
<br><br>
2) Cannot be Target Locked.
<br><br>
3) Gains +3 defense dice when defending.
<br><br>
4) May perform a <img src='img/stuff/action_sensor_echo.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Sensor Echo'>
Action as a free Action with a 1  <img src='img/stuff/maneuver_straight.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Straight'>
Maneuver Template after it moves during the Activation Phase, even if it does not have that Action on its Action Bar.
<br><br>
5) Must roll 2 attack dice when attempting to use any text ability that is triggered by a («Token. The attempt fails and the ability does not work if at least 1

<br><br>
6) Suffers 1 damage to its Hull at the end of every End Phase. If its Hull is already damaged at the start of the End Phase, that ship rolls 1 attack die for each damage card assigned to it. If at least 1

is rolled, the ship suffers a critical damage instead of a normal damage for that round.
<br><br>
<b>ANTIMATTER MINES:</b> Attacks made with the Antimatter Mine Upgrade are at +1 attack die. In addition, any ship in the nebula that ends its move within Range 1 of an Antimatter Minefield Token triggers the minefield.

  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
The Caretaker's array is a space station created by the Nacene and was operated by the Caretaker to supply energy and protection to the Ocampa, an underground dwelling race that lives on the desert planet Ocampa. Shortly after the death of the Caretaker, the Kazon-Ogla sect that inhabits the surface of the planet is attempting to take over the array. A Federation ship that was brought to the quadrant by the array's powerful displacement wave plans to destroy the Caretaker's array so that it does not fall into the hands of the Kazon. The Kazon-Ogla have sent ships to prevent this from happening.

<br><br>
  <!-- Setup -->
  <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
  <!-- Player 1 -->
  <b>Federation Player:</b> 80 SP, including at least one Federation ship with a Hull of 4 or greater and at least one other ship with a Hull of 3 or less.

<br><br>
  <!-- Player 2 -->
  <b>Kazon Player:</b> 100 SP, including at least one Predator class ship.

<br><br>

  <!-- Map Setup -->
  <b>Map Setup:</b> Place the Objective Token directly in the center of the play area. Place the Planet Token centered from E to W (on the side of the play area closest to the N edge of the play area) so that there is exactly 4" between it and the Objective Token. The Federation Player sets up in a 4" x 36" area along the N edge of the play area. Then the Kazon player sets up in an 8" x 36" area along the S edge of the play area.
<br><br>
  <!-- Special Rules -->
  <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
<b>THE ARRAY:</b> The Objective Token represents the Caretaker's array. The array does not move or perform Actions. During the End Phase of every round, the array repairs 1 damage to its Hull. If it has no damage to its Hull, it repairs 1 Shield Token. It has the following stats:
<br><br>
Primary Weapon: 0* | Agility: 0** | Hull: 8 | Shields: 8
<br><br>
*The array does not attack as normal. Instead, each round it sends out a displacement wave.
<br>
**The array rolls a number of defense dice equal to the range of the attack (i.e. 1 defense die when being attacked at Range 1, 2 defense dice at Range 2, and 3 defense dice at Range 3).
<br><br>
<b>DISPLACEMENT WAVE:</b> At the end of each Activation Phase after all ships have moved, the array sends out a displacement wave to 1 of the 4 sectors in the play area. The 4 sectors are the N sector, the E sector, the S sector and the W sector. Each sector extends from the center of the array to the 2 corners of the play area at either end of that the edge of the sector. <i>For example, the N sector is the 3 triangular area between the center of the array and the NE and NW corners of the play area.</i>
<br><br>
Starting with the N sector on the first round, each round the affected sector changes to the next sector in clockwise rotation (N, then E, then S, then W, etc.). Each ship within the affected sector is attacked with 6 attack dice and may defend as normal. The array does not inflict normal damage. Instead, if a ship has any uncanceled 
<img src='img/stuff/effect_hit.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Hit Result'>
 or 
<img src='img/stuff/effect_crit.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Crit Result'>
results, that ship is immediately removed from the play area and placed back into the play area somewhere in the next sector in counter-clockwise rotation. The opposing player chooses where in the sector to place the ship and the ship's owner chooses its facing. Ships moved in this manner cannot be placed within 4" of Token or any edge of the play area. If the number of uncanceled 
<img src='img/stuff/effect_hit.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Hit Result'>
 or 
<img src='img/stuff/effect_crit.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Crit Result'>
results equals or exceeds the total amount of Active Shields and Hull Points that the affected ship has left, that ship is removed from the game.
 <br><br><br>
  <!-- Objectives -->
  <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>

<b>Kazon Player:</b> You win if none of the Federation player's ships are left in the play area (either destroyed or removed) and the array is not destroyed.

<br><br>

<b>Federation Player:</b> You win if you destroy the array and exit the play area with at least one of your ships. Alternatively, you win if you destroy all of the Kazon player's ships.

  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
Responding to a distress call outside the Romulan Neutral Zone, a Federation ship rendezvous with the USS Yamato. The Yamato located the planet Iconia and was attacked by a probe that was launched from the surface of the planet which caused system malfunctions in the Yamato, ultimately destroying it. The Federation ship becomes infected with the same malfunctions after downloading the Yamato's logs and attempts to go to the planet Iconia to fix the problem. In the meantime, a Romulan Warbird, which also downloaded the Yamato's logs, confronts the Federation ship.

<br><br>

  <!-- Map Setup -->
  <b>Map Setup:</b> Place the Planet Token centered E to W so that there is exactly 4" between it and the S edge of the play area. Place 1 Mission Token on top of each player's Ship Card, and then place the remaining 10 Mission Tokens beside the play area. The Mission Tokens represent the probes sent from the surface of the planet Iconia as well as the number of system malfunctions caused by the Iconian operating systems downloaded to a ship. Players then set up in a 4" x 36" area along the N edge of the play area.
<br><br>
  <!-- Special Rules -->
  <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
<b>ICONIAN PROBES:</b> Each round, place 2 Mission Tokens in the play area, exactly 4′′ from the edge of the Planet Token, one in the direction of each ship, i.e. along the imaginary lines between the center of the Planet Token and the centers of the ships' bases (use the Range Ruler to find these lines). These Mission Tokens are considered probes. Probes perform a 2
<img src='img/stuff/maneuver_straight.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Battlestation'>
 maneuver at the end of each Activation Phase towards the nearest ship. If a probe or its maneuver template overlaps a ship's base, place that Mission Token on top of that ship's Ship Card. If a ship is within Range 1 of the Planet Token, place 1 Mission Token directly on top of that Ship Card, instead of in the play area. Tokens that are on top of a Ship Card represent additional system malfunctions on that ship. Probes can be destroyed by inflicting 1 damage to them. Probes roll 2 defense dice against attacks.
<br><br>
<b>SYSTEM MALFUNCTIONS:</b> Every round during the Planning Phase, for each Mission Token on top of a Ship Card, that ship suffers 1 normal damage and that player must remove from the game 1 Upgrade Card at random and 1 Shield Token (active or disabled) from his ship. If a ship has no Upgrades or Shields left, it suffers 1 additional damage per Mission Token. If there is at least 1 Mission Token on a 3 Ship Card during the End Phase of every round, add 1 Mission Token to that Ship Card. If a Mission Token is destroyed, it is removed from the game. If a Mission Token is removed from a Ship Card it is put back in the supply. If a Mission Token is supposed to be placed (either in the play area or on a Ship Card) and there are no Mission Tokens left in the supply, no Mission Token is placed.
<br><br>

<b>REMOVING THE DATA:</b> During the Activation Phase, a ship that is within Range 1-2 of the Planet Token may disable all of its remaining Shields and use one of the following Actions:
<br><br>
ACTION: Remove 1 Mission Token from on top of your Ship Card. OR
<br><br>
ACTION: Roll 3 attack dice. For each
<img src='img/stuff/effect_hit.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Hit Result'>

result, add 1 Mission Token to the top of your Ship Card.
<br><br>
A ship cannot attack during the round that it uses one of these Actions.

  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
A Federation ship had been searching for the U.S.S Defiant, which went missing. They found it with all of its crew dead and the ship itself beginning to blink in and out of phase. The Defiant suddenly phases into a parallel universe with the Federation ship's captain on board and now the Federation ship must wait near that exact point in space for the next period of interphase to retrieve their captain. If they expend too much energy, the dimensional rift between the 2 universes will be destroyed and their captain will be lost. During this time, a Tholian vessel comes across the Federation ship and orders it to leave Tholian space or be destroyed. Will the Federation ship be able to retrieve its captain?

<br><br>
  <!-- Setup -->
  <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
  <!-- Player 1 -->
  <b>Federation Player:</b> 40 SP, including one (and only one) Federation ship with at least 1 Upgrade.

<br><br>
  <!-- Player 2 -->
  <b>Independent Player:</b> 50 SP, including at least one Tholian Vessel equipped with an Energy Web Upgrade. In addition, all of the Independent player's ships must have a Hull value of 2 or less.

<br><br>

  <!-- Map Setup -->
  <b>Map Setup:</b> Place the Objective Token directly in the center of the play area. The Independent player sets up anywhere in the play area within Range 1 of any edge of the play area. Then the Federation player sets up anywhere within Range 1 of the Objective Token. Place the 4 Mission Tokens on top of the Objective Token. At the start of the game, the Federation Captain Card is turned face down. This represents that the captain is aboard the U.S.S. Defiant which has phased into a parallel universe. The Federation ship is considered to have a Skill of "1" while its Captain Card is face down. The Captain Card cannot be used until it is retrieved during an interphase.
<br><br>
  <!-- Special Rules -->
  <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
<b>INTERPHASE:</b> The Objective Token represents the location of the next interphase (i.e. the point in space where the U.S.S. Defiant will reappear with the Federation Captain). During the End Phase of each round, remove 1 Mission Token from the Objective Token and place it on top of the Federation Ship Card. When there are no Mission Tokens on top of the Objective Token, the next interphase occurs.
<br><br>
<b>RETRIEVING THE CAPTAIN:</b> The Federation ship must be within Range 1 of the Objective Token when an interphase occurs (i.e. during the End Phase of the round in which the last Mission Token is removed from the Objective Token) in order to retrieve its Captain. If there is at least 1 Mission Token on the Federation Ship Card when the interphase occurs, flip the Federation Captain Card face up. The captain is considered to be back aboard the Federation ship. If there are no Mission Tokens on the Federation Ship Card during the interphase, the dimensional rift has been damaged and the captain is not retrieved. If this happens, place the 4 Mission Tokens back on the Objective Token and continue until another interphase occurs.
<br><br>

<b>DAMAGING THE DIMENSIONAL RIFT:</b> Any time the Federation ship is within Range 1 of the Objective Token, remove 1 Mission Token from on top of the Federation ship card (if possible) if one of the following occurs: 1) The Federation ship fires its weapons, OR 2) The Federation ship performs a maneuver with a speed greater than 2, OR 3) An Independent ship is also within Range 1 of the Objective Token and fires its weapons at the Federation ship.
<br><br>
<b>MADNESS:</b> During the Planning Phase of each round, the Federation player rolls 1 attack die. On a 
<img src='img/stuff/action_battlestations.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Battlestation'>
result, the Federation player removes 1 
<img src='img/stuff/effect_crew.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Crew Upgrade'>
Upgrade (his choice) from the game. If the Federation player has no 
<img src='img/stuff/effect_crew.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Crew Upgrade'>

  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
The Romulans have developed an unmanned drone ship that they are able to control from Romulus. This ship can not only take on the appearance of any other vessel, but it can match the vessel's weapons signature as well. They have sent one of these drones on a mission to disrupt the peace talks in the sector. A Federation ship has followed this vessel and is attempting to thwart the Romulan's plans of destabilizing the sector.

  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
Upon exiting a plasma drift, a Federation starship finds itself caught in a subspace divergence and is being bombarded with proton bursts which are causing great damage to the ship. They have discovered that the source of these bursts seems to be from an alternate reality copy of their own ship in their exact location. While trying to figure out how to stop the crippling effects of these bursts, the ship is set upon by a Vidiian Battle Cruiser.

<br><br>
  <!-- Setup -->
  <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
  <!-- Player 1 -->
  <b>Federation Player:</b> 35 SP, including one (and only one) Federation ship. Place an additional 25 SP of Upgrades near your cards, to be used as a sideboard throughout the Mission.

Fast approaching Terok Nor, the Regent's Flagship and a small contingency of Warbirds intend to take back the space station and punish the rebels aboard. The expediency of the attack is fueled by the awareness of a new weapon the rebels have, a replica of a Prime Universe Defiant Class space craft.

A Dominion fleet is attempting to retake Terok Nor before the Federation can live up to its threat and activate a minefield of self-replicating mines just outside of the Bajoran Wormhole. This minefield would stand in the way of a vast fleet of Dominion ships entering the Alpha Quadrant, so the Dominion Captain has ordered his attack fighters to break formation in an attempt to outflank the Federation and Klingon ships and prevent the minefield from being activated.

The Dominion Player takes 1 Mission Token from beside the play area and places it next to his cards (i.e. breaks formation) when either: 1) one of his ships, while it is not within Range 1-2 of a friendly ship, attacks an enemy ship, OR 2) one of his Attack Squadrons performs the Action listed on the "Break Formation" Upgrade. If the Dominion Player ever has all of the Mission Tokens beside his Ship Cards, the minefield is prevented from being activated.
<br><br>

If a ship is destroyed, the attacking player takes one of his opponent's Mission Tokens (if any) and places it beside his cards.

  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
A fleet of Federation ships has been mustered to stop the advance of a Borg Cube that has entered the Wolf 359 System. The Cube is led by Locutus and is on its way to Sector 001 to assimilate or destroy the Earth. This Cube is more powerful than anything the Federation has faced before and with the assimilated Jean-Luc Picard in command, it poses even more of a threat. Will the Federation fleet be able to overcome Locutus or will this be the final stand for the over- powered Federation ships?

<br><br>
  <!-- Setup -->
  <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
  <!-- Player 1 -->
  <b>Borg Player:</b> 150 SP, including one (and only one) Borg Cube with Locutus assigned as its Captain. The Borg ship may be equipped with any number of Borg Upgrades, even if these Upgrades exceed the ship's restrictions.

<br><br>
  <!-- Player 2 -->
  <b>Federation Player:</b> 150 Squadron Points, including at least 3 Federation ships. The Federation player cannot assign Jean-Luc Picard as one of his Captains.
<br><br>

  <!-- Map Setup -->
  <b>Map Setup:</b> The Federation player sets up along any edge of the play area, within 4" of the edge. The Borg Cube then sets up directly in the center of the play area. Place 2 Mission Tokens on each of the Federation Player's Ship Cards.
<br><br>
  <!-- Special Rules -->
  <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
<b>ASSIMILATED INFORMATION:</b> Whenever the Borg Cube is damaged by or damages a Federation ship, if there are still any Mission Tokens on that Federation Ship Card, remove 1 Mission Token from it and place it on the Borg player's Ship Card. This represents Locutus's assimilated knowledge of the Federation. Each round, the Borg Player may discard any number of these Mission Tokens (1-at-a-time) from his Ship Card to achieve the following effects:
<br><br>
DURING THE PLANNING PHASE:
<br>
1) Repair up to 3 Damage of your choice to your Hull or Shields. (once per round)
<br>
2) Add up to 4 Drone Tokens to your Captain Card. You cannot exceed your Captain's starting number of Drone Tokens. (once per round)
<br><br>
DURING THE COMBAT PHASE (when you are defending):
<br>
3) During the Roll Attack dice step, force the attacking ship to roll -3 attack dice for all of its attacks that round. (once per round per attacking ship)
<br>
4) During the Compare Results step, cancel up to 3 
<img src='img/stuff/effect_hit.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Hit Result'>
or 
<img src='img/stuff/effect_crit.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Crit Result'>
results. (once per round)
<br>
5) During the Roll Defense Dice step, force the defending ship to roll-3 defense dice against all of your attacks that round (once per round per defending ship).
<br>
6) During the Compare Results step, convert all of your 
<img src='img/stuff/effect_hit.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Hit Result'>
results into 
<img src='img/stuff/effect_crit.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Crit Result'>
results (once per round).
<br><br>
DURING THE END PHASE:
<br>
7) Target a ship at Range 1-2 and disable up 2 Upgrades on that ship. (once per round)

<br><br><br>

  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
A Defiant class starship finds itself suddenly under attack by a much larger ship that has decloaked right behind them. Luckily for the smaller ship, one of its crew members had previously been aboard the enemy vessel and sabotaged it, leveling the playing field and giving them a chance to defeat it or at least escape with their lives.

<br><br>
  <!-- Setup -->
  <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
  <!-- Player 1 -->
  <b>Mirror Universe Player:</b> 40 SP, including one (and only one) Defiant Class ship.

<br><br>
  <!-- Player 2 -->
  <b>Enemy Player:</b> 70 SP, including one (and only one) ship with a Hull Value of 6 or more.
<br><br>

  <!-- Map Setup -->
  <b>Map Setup:</b> First, the Mirror Universe Player sets up in a 4" x 4" area directly in the center of the play area. Then the Enemy Player sets up anywhere else in the play area outside of that 4" x 4" area.
<br><br>
  <!-- Special Rules -->
  <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
<b>SABOTAGE:</b> Unbeknownst to the Enemy ship, they have been sabotaged by a crewmember of the Defiant Class ship. Once both of the ships are set up, the Enemy Player must disable its Captain Card and all of its Upgrades. In addition, place 2 Mission Tokens on the Enemy ship's Ship Card and 1 Mission Token on every other card assigned to the Enemy ship.
<br><br>
While there are 2 Mission Tokens on the Enemy's Ship Card, that ship cannot select a Maneuver with a speed higher than 2 and rolls -2 attack dice when attacking.
<br><br>
While there is 1 Mission Token on the Enemy's Ship Card, that ship cannot select a Maneuver with a speed higher than 3 and rolls -1 attack die when attacking.
<br><br>
<b>REPAIRING THE DAMAGE DONE:</b> During the End Phase of each round, remove 1 Mission Token from 1 of the Enemy Ship's cards (Enemy Player's choice). NOTE: A disabled card remains disabled even if the Mission Token was removed from it.

<br><br><br>
  <!-- Objectives -->
  <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>

<b>Mirror Universe Player:</b> You win if you destroy the Enemy ship OR if you exit the play area while there are no Mission Tokens on any of the Enemy ship’s cards. You lose if you exit the play area while there are any Mission Tokens still on any of the Enemy ship’s cards.
<br><br>

<b>Enemy Player:</b> You win if you destroy the Mirror Universe ship.

  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
A rogue Reman Warbird has followed a Federation ship from Romulus and now the 2 ships have entered into the area of space between Romulus and the Romulan Neutral Zone known as the Bassen Rift. This is the perfect place for the Warbird to spring its ambush. The electromagnetic distortions within the Bassen Rift will prevent the Federation ship from using any long range communications. But, unbeknownst to the Warbird, another Romulan ship has entered the Rift to battle alongside the Federation ship against the rogue vessel.

5) Any ship that overlaps another ship at the end of its movement must move backward along its chosen Maneuver Template until it no longer overlaps the other ship. This ship cannot perform any Actions during that round. In addition, both ships must roll a number of defense dice equal to 1/2 of their Captain's Skill Number (rounded up). Each ship sustains 2 damage to its Hull, minus 1 damage for every

While being pursued by a Cardassian Galor-class ship, a Maquis Raider attempts a desperate escape. Its captain is sure that their pursuer would not dare follow them into the Badlands, an area of space riddled with plasma storms and gravitational anomalies. But he is mistaken, and the Cardassian stays close behind, not wanting to lose its quarry in this treacherous zone.

<br><br>

  <!-- Map Setup -->
  <b>Map Setup:</b> Starting with the Independent Player, players in turn place the 12 Mission Tokens, one at a time, anywhere in the play area, with the following restriction: No Mission Token may be placed within Range 1 of any edge of the play area or any other Mission Token. The Dominion Player then sets up in a 36" x 4" area along the S edge of the play area. The Independent Player then sets up anywhere in a 36" x 8" area along the N edge of the Dominion Player's starting area. NOTE: Ships cannot set up touching any of the Mission Tokens.
<br><br>
  <!-- Special Rules -->
  <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
<b>MOVEMENT IN THE BADLANDS:</b> The entire play area is considered to be covered by plasma storms and the Mission Tokens represent the safe routes through the Badlands.
<br><br>
When either ship moves, if the ship's base or Maneuver Template overlaps at least 1 Mission Token, the ship has successfully avoided the Plasma Storms and suffers no damage for that round. If the ship's base or Maneuver Template does not overlap at least 1 Mission Token, that ship suffers 1 damage
<br><br>

<b>ESCAPING PURSUIT:</b> If the Independent ship's base or Maneuver Template overlaps a Mission Token, that ship may remove that Mission Token from the play area and place it on its Ship Card. When there are at least 7 Mission Tokens on the Independent Ship Card, that ship may safely make its escape.

<br><br><br>
  <!-- Objectives -->
  <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>

<b>Independent Player:</b> Escape safely from the Dominion ship's pursuit (i.e. exit the play area with at least 7 Mission Tokens on your Ship Card). If the Independent ship exits the play area with less than 7 Mission Tokens, that player loses.
<br><br>

<b>Dominion Player:</b> Destroy the Independent ship and have your ship exit the play area. If the Dominion player's ship is destroyed before exiting the play area OR exits the play area before destroying the Independent ship, the Dominion Player loses.

  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
A Federation ship has entered a transwarp conduit and plans to destroy the Borg transwarp network by destroying a series of interspatial manifolds. If successful, a chain reaction would occur and the entire transwarp network would collapse from within. They have to destroy just one more of these interspatial manifolds for this to happen, but the shockwave that would occur if they succeed could destroy their ship along with the network. It is the risk they are willing to take to stop the Borg. Realizing what the Federation ship is doing, a Borg Octahedron followed them into the conduit to stop them.

<br><br>
  <!-- Setup -->

<br><br>
  <!-- Player 2 -->
  <b>Federation Player:</b> 70 SP, including one (and only one) ship.
<br><br>

  <!-- Map Setup -->
  <b>Map Setup:</b> Place the Objective Token, centered from E to W, so that there is exactly 4" between it and the N edge of the play area. The Federation ship then sets up in a 4" x 4" area, centered from E to W, along the S edge of the play area. The Borg Octahedron is placed to the side of the play area at the start of the mission.
<br><br>
  <!-- Special Rules -->
  <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
<b>INTERSPATIAL MANIFOLD:</b> The Objective Token represents the last Interspatial Manifold that needs to be destroyed by the Federation ship. It is treated as an enemy ship and it is considered to have a Hull Value of 5 and a Shield Value of 5. It does not move, attack or take Actions. During the End Phase of each round, repair 2 of the Interspatial Manifold's Shield Tokens.
<br><br>

<b>BORG PURSUIT:</b> The Borg Octahedron does not enter the play area until the 2nd round. During the Planning Phase of the 2nd round, the Borg player places his ship in the same starting area that the Federation ship used (4" x 4" centered from E to W along the S edge of the play area).
<br><br>

<b>SHOCKWAVE:</b> When the Interspatial Manifold is destroyed, a shockwave moves through the play area. If this occurs, roll 8 attack dice for each ship within Range 1 of the Objective Token, 6 attack dice for each ship within Range 2 of the the Objective Token, 4 attack dice for each ship within Range 3 of the Objective Token and 2 attack dice for each ship beyond Range 3 of the Objective Token.

result damages the ships as normal. Ships do not roll defense dice against this damage.

<br><br><br>
  <!-- Objectives -->
  <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>

<b>Federation Player:</b> Destroy the Interspatial Manifold and exit the play area. If your ship exits the play area before the Interspatial Manifold is destroyed OR your ship is destroyed by a shockwave, you lose.
<br><br>

<b>Borg Player:</b> Destroy the Federation ship before the Interspatial Manifold is destroyed.

  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
The area of space known as the "Briar Patch" is a dangerous area of Sector 441 and ships passing through it must travel using only partial impulse power or risk damaging their ship's engines. A Federation Sovereign class starship has found itself inside this cloud and is under attack by enemy ships. Only a captain of great skill and ingenuity will be able to win this battle and leave the deadly "Briar Patch" in one piece.

<br><br>
  <!-- Setup -->
  <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
  <!-- Player 1 -->
  <b>Enemy Player:</b> 70 SP, including two (and only two) ships.

<br><br>
  <!-- Player 2 -->
  <b>Federation Player:</b> 60 SP, including one (and only one) Sovereign Class ship.
<br><br>

  <!-- Map Setup -->
  <b>Map Setup:</b> First, the players set up in a standard 2 player game. The Federation player then places the 6 Objective Tokens anywhere in the play area, with the following restriction: No Objective Token may be placed within Range 2 of any edge of the play area, any ship, or any other Objective Token. NOTE: The Objective Tokens represent particularly dangerous areas of space debris and deadly radiation.
<br><br>
  <!-- Special Rules -->
  <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
<b>MOVEMENT IN THE BRIAR PATCH:</b> No ship can safely travel through the Briar Patch at speeds higher than 2. Any ship that performs a Maneuver with a number greater than 2, suffers 1 damage for every point of that Maneuver over 2. This damage occurs immediately after the ship moves, before taking any Actions.
<br><br>
A player who has just performed a Maneuver greater than 2 may immediately place an Auxiliary Power Token beside his ship to decrease the damage by 1.
<br><br>
If a ship has no Active Shields when suffering damage in this way, the damage applied to that ship's Hull is treated as critical damage.
<br><br>
<i>Example: The Federation ship performs a 4t Maneuver. The maneuver is 2 greater than the safe speed of 2, so that ship will suffer 2 damage for performing the maneuver. The ship has no Active Shields left, so the damage will be applied to the ship's Hull. That ship's player chooses to place an Auxiliary Power Token beside his ship, so the total damage is reduced to 1 critical damage.</i>
<br><br>

<b>SPACE DEBRIS AND RADIATION:</b> The Objective Tokens are treated as Obstacles (see page 22 of the Full Rules of Play) with the following exceptions:
<br><br>
If a ship's base or Maneuver Template overlaps an Obstacle Token, that ship rolls 3 attack dice. Any 
<img src='img/stuff/effect_hit.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Hit Result'>
or 
<img src='img/stuff/effect_crit.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Crit Result'>
result damages the ship as normal. Ships cannot roll defense dice against this damage.
<br><br>
If a ship fires through an Obstacle, the Obstacle explodes and all ships within Range 1 of the Obstacle Token suffer damage as though they had overlapped the Obstacle Token. If an Obstacle token explodes in this manner, remove it from the play area. NOTE: Ships cannot directly attack Obstacle Tokens.

<br><br><br>
  <!-- Objectives -->
  <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>

<b>Federation Player:</b> Destroy both enemy ships and exit the play area.
<br><br>

<b>Enemy Player:</b> Destroy the Federation ship and have at least 1 of your ships exit the play area.
<br><br>

If either player’s ship(s) exit the play area before destroying their opponent’s ship(s), that player loses.

  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
A Borg Scout Cube was sent to locate a Borg ship that crashed in the Argolis System and retrieve any surviving Drones and Borg technology from the crash site. Prior to the Borg Scout Cube arriving in the system, a Federation ship found the crashed Borg ship and rescued a lone Borg Drone that has been disconnected from the Hive Mind. A plan was devised to introduce a virus into the Borg's root command system by implanting the virus into the Borg Drone and then re-introducing the Drone back into the Collective. The virus is intended to spread through the Collective and destroy them from within.
<br><br>
  <!-- Setup -->
  <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
  <!-- Player 1 -->
  <b>Borg Player:</b> 40 SP including 1 (and only 1) Borg Scout Cube.
<br><br>
  <!-- Player 2 -->
  <b>Federation Player:</b> 50 SP including 1 (and only 1) Federation ship.
<br><br>

  <!-- Map Setup -->
  <b>Map Setup:</b> Place the Planet Token directly in the center of the play area. Place 1 Objective Token so that there is exactly 8" between it and the S and W edges of the play area. Place the 2nd Objective Token so that there is exactly 8" between it and the S and E edges of the play area. The Objective Tokens represent points in the Argolis System that the Borg Scout Cube must search in order to locate the site of the crashed Borg ship. Place the Mission Tokens beside the play area. The players then set up as in a standard 2-player game.
<br><br>
  <!-- Special Rules -->
  <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
<b>LOCATING THE CRASH SITE:</b> The Borg Scout Cube may perform the following Action:
<br><br>
ACTION: Target 1 Objective Token within Range 1 of your ship. Remove that Objective Token from the game. If the Federation ship is within Range 1-3 of your ship, also remove 1 Mission Token (from beside the play area) from the game as well, if possible.
<br><br>
Once the 2 Objective Tokens are removed, the Borg Scout Cube can then locate the crash site by performing a
<img src='img/stuff/action_scan.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Scan'>
Action within Range 1 of the Planet Token.
<br><br>

<b>IMPLANTING THE VIRUS:</b> When the Federation ship is within Range 1 of the Planet Token, it may perform the following Action:
<br><br>
ACTION: Roll 3 attack dice. If you roll at least 1
<img src='img/stuff/effect_hit.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Hit Result'>
or 
<img src='img/stuff/effect_crit.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Crit Result'>
result, place 1 Mission Token on your Ship Card.
<br><br>
When there are 2 Mission Tokens on your Ship Card, you have successfully implanted the virus in the Borg Drone. If you have implanted the virus and are within Range 1 of the Planet Token, you may perform the following Action:
<br><br>
ACTION: Roll 2 attack dice. If you roll at least 1
<img src='img/stuff/effect_hit.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Hit Result'>
or 
<img src='img/stuff/effect_crit.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Crit Result'>
result, remove 2 Mission Tokens from your Ship Card and place them on the Planet Token. This represents that the Borg Drone has beamed to the crash site.
<br><br>

The Federation ship cannot attack the Borg Scout Cube until the Borg Scout Cube has located the crash. site. The Borg Scout Cube cannot attack the Federation ship until the Federation ship has beamed the Borg Drone back to the crash site.

<br><br><br>
  <!-- Objectives -->
  <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>

<b>Federation Player:</b> You win if you beam the Borg Drone with the implanted virus back to the crash site before the Borg Scout Cube locates the crash site and then return to Federation space. (i.e. remove 2 Mission Tokens from your Ship Card and place them onto the Planet Token and then leave the play area through your starting area). Alternatively, you win by destroying the Borg Scout Cube after it has located the crash site.
<br><br>

<b>Borg Player:</b> You win if you locate the crash site before the Federation ship beams the Borg Drone with the implanted virus back to the crash site and then return to Borg space. (i.e. perform a ((< Action within Range 1 of the Planet Token when there is not a Mission Token on it and then exit the play area through your starting area). Alternatively, you win by destroying the Federation ship after it has beamed the Borg Drone back to the crash site.

NOTE: The Minefield Token and the Objective Tokens form the Cloaked Minefield that the Federation ship has found itself within.
<br><br>
  <!-- Special Rules -->
  <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
<b>CLOAKED MINEFIELD:</b> Once per round, during the Planning Phase, the Romulan player may remove the Minefield Token from its current position and place it so that its edge touches the edge of one of the remaining Objective Tokens. The Objective Token that it touches is then removed from the game.
<br><br>
If the Federation ship passes within Range 1 of the Minefield Token, roll 3 attack dice (-1 if the Federation ship immediately performs a
<img src='img/stuff/action_scan.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Scan'>

<br><br>

<b>ROMULAN SHIPS:</b> Once per round, one of the Romulan ships may perform the following Action:
<br><br>
ACTION: Remove the Minefield Token from its current position and place it within Range 2 of your ship (in any direction), but not within Range 2 of an enemy ship. You cannot place the Minefield Token so that it touches an Objective Token. Place an Auxiliary Power Token beside your ship.
<br><br>
<b>FEDERATION SHIPS:</b> During the Activation Phase, if you performed a Green Maneuver, you may perform the following Action:
<br><br>
ACTION: The Romulan player cannot roll more than 1 attack die this round for any Minefield Token that is attempting to damage the your ship. In addition, you may roll your full defense dice against any Minefield Token this round. Place an Auxiliary Power Token beside your ship. NOTE: The Federation ship cannot perform this Action if it is overlapping an Objective Token after it moves.

<br><br><br>
  <!-- Objectives -->
  <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>

<b>Federation Player:</b> You win if you successfully leave the Minefield (i.e. exit the play area through the Romulan player's starting area). You lose if you exit the play area through any edge other the Romulan player's starting area. Alternatively, you win if you destroy all enemy ships.

The Enterprise is the only Federation ship in proximity of Earth that can attempt to intercept this anomaly, but it is docked at a space station orbiting the Earth and is still in the final stages of reconstruction. Admiral Kirk must make some hard decisions as he weighs the necessary risks of taking action before his ship is fully prepared.

  <!-- Setup -->
  <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
  <!-- Player 1 -->
  <b>Klingon Player:</b> 90 SP, including at least 3 ships. None of these ships can have a Hull value greater than 4.
<br><br>
  <!-- Player 2 -->
  <b>Federation Player:</b> 40 SP, including one (and only one) Constitution Class ship. You cannot assign Mr. Spock to this ship
<br><br>

  <!-- Map Setup -->
  <b>Map Setup:</b> Place the Planet Token in the SE corner of the play area, so that it touches the S and E edges. Then, place the V'Ger Token at a 45° angle in the NW corner of the play area, so that it touches the N and Wedges. Place the Objective Token in the SW corner of the play area so that there is exactly 4" between it and the S and Wedges. Then place 1 Mission Token on top of the Objective Token and the remaining Mission Tokens to the side of the play area. The Federation ship sets up anywhere around the Planet Token so that the back edge of its base touches the edge of the Planet Token. Place 3 Auxiliary Power Tokens beside the Federation ship. NOTE: You may use Montgomery Scott's ability to prevent one of these Auxiliary Power Tokens from being placed at the start of the game. The Klingon ships set up in a 4" x 12" area in the NE corner of the play area.
<br><br>

<!-- Special Rules -->
<b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>

<b>FEDERATION SHIP:</b> The refit of Federation ship is incomplete. While there is at least 1 Auxiliary Power Token beside the ship, you cannot choose a Maneuver with a number greater than 3.
<br><br>

<b>V’GER APPROACHES THE EARTH:</b> At the start of each Activation Phase, move the V'Ger Token towards the Planet Token using the 2
<img src='img/stuff/maneuver_straight.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Straight'>
Maneuver Template. After V'Ger moves, place 1 Mission Token on top of the V'Ger Token. If the V'Ger Token overlaps a ship's base at the end of its move, place the V'Ger Token under the ship where it ended its move, instead of moving it back along the Maneuver Template. Then place an Auxiliary Power Token beside the ship.
<br><br>

<b>COMMUNICATE WITH V’GER:</b> The Klingons cannot commmunicate with V'Ger. During the Activation Phase, if the Federation ship is within Range 1-2 of the V'Ger Token, it may attempt to communicate with V'Ger by performing the following Action:
<br><br>
ACTION: Roll 1 attack die (2 if within Range 1 of V'Ger). For each
<img src='img/stuff/effect_crit.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Crit Result'>
result, place 1 Mission Token on the Planet Token. You may discard the Ilia 
<img src='img/stuff/effect_crew.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Crew Upgrade'>
Upgrade from your ship to roll an additional +1 attack die this round. If the Ilia 
<img src='img/stuff/effect_crew.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Crew Upgrade'>
Upgrade was discarded from your ship on a previous round, you may discard Will Decker from your ship to set one of your dice on the side of your choice this round (this die cannot be rolled or re-rolled this round).
<br><br>
If Admiral Kirk is assigned to your ship, add +1 attack die to each communication attempt. In addition, if Mr. Spock is aboard your ship, add an additional +1 attack die to each communication attempt AND place 1 Mission Token on the Planet Token for every 
<img src='img/stuff/action_battlestations.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Battlestation'>
result instead of every 
<img src='img/stuff/effect_crit.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Crit Result'>
result.
<br><br>

<b>MR. SPOCK:</b>  If the Federation ship is within Range 1 of the Objective Token, it may perform the following Action:
<br><br>

ACTION: Remove the Mission Token from the Objective Token and place it on your Ship Card. This represents that Mr. Spock is now aboard your ship.
<br><br>

<b>COMBAT PHASE:</b> V'Ger is considered an enemy ship. It cannot be destroyed, nor can it receive critical damage (convert all 
<img src='img/stuff/effect_crit.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Crit Result'>
results against V'Ger into 
<img src='img/stuff/effect_hit.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Hit Result'>
results). If V'Ger has at least 4 TOTAL Damage Cards beside it at the end of the Combat Phase, remove 1 Mission Token from the V'Ger Token (only 1 per round). If V'Ger is attacked, it will retaliate. After all ships have made their attacks, V'Ger makes a 10-dice attack against each ship that attacked it that round. When attacking, V'Ger converts all of its 
<img src='img/stuff/action_battlestations.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Battlestation'>
results into 
<img src='img/stuff/effect_hit.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Hit Result'>
results. V'Ger will also attack the Federation ship (as above) if it made an attempt to communicate with V'Ger. NOTE: The Federation ship cannot attack V'Ger.
<br><br>

<b>END PHASE:</b> During the End Phase, discard all Damage Cards from V'Ger. If the V'Ger Token is overlapping the Planet Token, the game ends.

  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
In an attempt to prevent the Dominion from sending reinforcements to the Alpha Quadrant, the Federation placed a minefield of self-replicating mines in front of the Bajoran Wormhole. Unable to prevent this action through diplomatic means, the Dominion sent a fleet to attack Deep Space 9, retake the station, and prevent the minefield from being activated. Though the attack was successful and the station is poised to be taken over by the Dominion fleet, the minefield can still be activated by the last Federation ship at the station with the aid of an allied Klingon starship. These last 2 ships must now try to activate the minefield and flee past the Dominion ships to rejoin their fleet.
<br><br>
  <!-- Setup -->
  <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
  <!-- Player 1 -->
  <b>Dominion Player:</b> 200 SP, including at least one Jem'Hadar Battle Cruiser.
<br><br>
  <!-- Player 2 -->
  <b>Federation Player:</b> 90 SP, including one (and only one) Federation ship and one (and only one) Klingon ship. Neither ship can have a Hull Value greater than 4.
<br><br>

  <!-- Map Setup -->
  <b>Map Setup:</b> The play area for this Mission is 36" x 48". Place 1 Objective Token so that there is exactly 8" between it and the S edge of the play area and 4" between it and the W edge of the play area. Place the 2nd Objective Token so that there is exactly 8" between it and the S edge of the play area and 4" between it and the E edge of the play area. Place 1 Mission Token on top of each Objective Token. The 2 players then set up as in a standard 2-player game.
<br><br>

<!-- Special Rules -->
<b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>

<b>ACTIVATING THE MINEFIELD:</b> If the Federation ship is within Range 1 of an Objective Token it may take the following Action:
<br><br>
ACTION: Target 1 Objective Token within Range 1 of your ship. Remove 1 Mission Token from that Objective Token and place it onto your Ship Card.
<br><br>
Once both Mission Tokens have been removed, the minefield is considered to be activated.
<br><br>
NOTE: The Objective Tokens represent the precise coordinates for activating the minefield. If the Federation or Klingon ship's base or Maneuver Template overlaps one of these Tokens during the Activation Phase, the minefield activation sequence is considered to be interrupted. Remove any Mission Tokens from the Federation Ship Card and place them back on top of the Objective Tokens (one Mission Token per Objective). The Federation ship may attempt to restart the minefield activation sequence using the Action above.

<br><br><br>
  <!-- Objectives -->
  <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>

<b>Federation/Klingon Player:</b> You win by activating the minefield (i.e. removing the 2 Mission Tokens from the Objective Tokens and placing them on top of your Ship Card) and then having both of your ships exit the play area through the Dominion player's starting area. If either of your ships are destroyed OR if either of your ships exit the play area while there is still at least 1 Mission Token on any Objective Token, or through any other edge other than the Dominion Player's starting area, you lose.
<br><br>

<b>Dominion Player:</b> You win by destroying either of your opponent's ships. Alternatively, you win if either of your opponent's ships exits the play area without activating the minefield or through an edge of the play area other than your starting area.

  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
A group of rebel drones have created a virtual construct they call "Uni-matrix Zero". They can enter it while regenerating and it allows them to be individuals while they are there. The Borg Queen has become aware of Unimatrix Zero and is attempting to locate and destroy it. The Unimatrix drones have reached out to a Federation ship for help and a nano virus has been developed that will allow them to retain their memories while not in the Unimatrix. The Federation ship must send an Away Team onto a nearby Tactical Cube and deliver the nano virus into its central plexus. Once it is delivered, the virus will spread throughout the hive mind and free all of the Unimatrix drones.

<!-- Special Rules -->
<b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>

<b>AWAY TEAM:</b> If the Federation ship is within Range 1-2 of the Borg ship it may perform one of the following 2 Actions:
<br><br>
ACTION: Disable your Captain and/or any number of your 
<img src='img/stuff/effect_crew.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Crew Upgrade'>
Upgrades of your choice (place Disabled Upgrade Tokens on these cards). These cards are considered to have beamed aboard the Borg ship as your "Away Team." You cannot remove these Disabled Upgrade Tokens without using the Action listed below. If your Captain is part of your Away Team, your ship is considered to have a Skill of 1.
<br><br>
ACTION: Remove the Disabled Upgrade Tokens from any cards that are part of your Away Team. These cards are now considered on board the ship and are no longer part of the "Away Team."
<br><br>

<b>DELIVERING THE NANO VIRUS:</b> During the End Phase of every round, the Federation player rolls 1 attack die for every member of his Away Team. If there is at least one

  <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>

<b>Federation Player:</b> Deliver the nano virus into the Borg ship's central plexus and return safely (i.e. beam an Away Team onto the Borg ship, place 1 Mission Token on the Borg Ship Card, return the Away Team to their ship, and then exit the play area). If the Federation ship exits the play area without delivering the nano virus or while its Away Team is still on the Borg Ship, the Federation player loses.
<br><br>

<b>Borg Player:</b> Destroy the Federation player's ships. Alternatively, the Borg player can win by successfully damaging the Federation ship with the Self Destruct Sequence Upgrade card after the nano virus has been delivered (i.e. the Mission Token is placed on the Borg Ship Card).

<b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>

<b>DEPLOYING THE LAUNCH SEQUENCERS:</b> If a Romulan ship is within Range 1 of the Moon Token, it may perform the following Action:
<br><br>
ACTION: If your ship is not Cloaked, disable all of your remaining Shields. Remove the Mission Token from your Ship Card and place it on the Moon Token.
<br><br>
When there are 3 Mission Tokens on the Moon Token, the Launch Sequencers have been deployed.
<br><br>

<b>BREAKING THE ALLIANCE:</b> The Bajoran Player cannot attack or cause damage to the Romulan Player's ships until there is at least 1 Mission Token on the Moon Token.
<br><br>
The Romulan Player cannot attack or cause damage to the Bajoran Player's ships until the Bajoran Player has attacked the Romulan Player's ships.
<br><br>

<b>FEDERATION INTERVENTION:</b> During the End Phase of every round, remove 1 Countdown Token from
3 the top of the stack. When the last Countdown Token is removed, the Federation intervenes.

<br><br><br>
  <!-- Objectives -->
  <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>

<b>Romulan Player:</b> The Romulan player wins by deploying the Launch Sequencers and then returning to Romulan space (i.e. placing 3 Mission Tokens on the Moon Token and then exiting the board through his starting area with all of his ships). The Romulan player loses if: A) any of the Romulan player's ships are destroyed after at least one Mission Token is placed on the Moon Token, OR B) any of the Romulan player's ships damage any of the Bajoran player's ships before the Bajoran player's ships have attacked, OR C) a Romulan ship leaves the play area anywhere other than through their starting area or with a Mission Token still on its Ship Card, OR D) the Federation intervenes in the engagement, and there is still at least one Romulan ship in the play area.
<br><br>

<b>Bajoran Player:</b> The Bajoran player wins by preventing the Romulan player from
deploying the Launch Sequencers and returning to Romulan Space. The Bajoran player loses if any of the Bajoran player's ships damage any of the Romulan player's ships before any Mission Tokens have been placed on the Moon Token.

  <!-- Map Setup -->
  <b>Map Setup:</b> Place the Vulcan ship centered from W to E so that the back of its base touches the N edge. Place the Federation ship centered from W to E so that the back of its base touches the S edge. Then place the 8 Cell Ship Tokens (CST) as follows: Place the 1st CST exactly 4" from the W edge of the Federation ship base and place the 2nd CST exactly 4" from the E edge of the Federation ship base. Both of these CSTs should also touch the S edge of the play area. Place the 3rd CST centered from W to E, exactly 4" from the S edge, and the 4th CST centered from W to E, exactly 8′′ from the S edge. Place the 5th CST exactly 4" from both the 1st CST and the 3rd CST. Place the 6th CST exactly 4" from both the 2nd CST and the 3rd CST. Place the 7th CST exactly 4" from both the 4th CST and the 5th CST. Then place the 8th CST exactly 4" from both the 4th CST and the 6th CST.
<br><br>

<!-- Special Rules -->
<b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>

<b>CELL SHIP TOKENS (CST):</b> Each of the Cell Ship Tokens are treated as enemy ships with the following abilities:
<br><br>
Primary Weapon 1 | Agility 1 | Hull 1 | Shields 0 | 360° firing arc
<br><br>
During the Activation Phase, each CST moves towards the nearest ship using the 3 Straight Maneuver Template. Place the end of the Maneuver Template next to the CST (so that it touches the CST). The template should follow a direct line towards the center of the ship's base. Move the CST along the Maneuver Template until it reaches the other end of the template. Once it reaches the end, place the CST so that it touches that end of the Maneuver Template and then remove the template. Follow these movement rules for each of the remaining CSTs until all of the CSTS in the play area have moved.
<br><br>
A CST's movement along the Maneuver Template will stop immediately if it touches a ship's base. NOTE: If this would cause the CST to overlap another CST, move the CST back along the Maneuver Template until it no longer overlaps the CST.
<br><br>
CSTS always move last and do not take any Actions.
<br><br>

During the Combat Phase, CSTs do not attack as normal. All CSTs that are within Range 1-3 of at least one ship combine their 1 die attacks and fire at the nearest ship as one attack. Each CST affects the total primary weapon bonuses for close and long range. <i>Example: 3 CSTs are at Range 1 of a ship and 2 CSTs are at Range 3 of that ship. The total attack would be 8 attack dice (two for each CST at Range 1 and two for the CSTS at Range 3). The defending ship would roll+2 defense dice (+1 for each CST at Range 3)</i>. NOTE: CST's always fire last.

<br><br><br>
  <!-- Objectives -->
  <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>

<b>Complete Success:</b> If both ships (Vulcan and Federation) leave the play area via the N edge, the Mission is a complete success. Both ships do not have to leave the play area during the same round for this success.
<br><br>

<b>Marginal Success:</b> If the Federation ship leaves the play area via the N edge, but the Vulcan ship is destroyed, the Mission is a marginal success.
<br><br>

<b>Failure:</b> If the Federation ship is destroyed or if either ship leaves the play area by any edge other than the N edge, the mission has failed.

  <br><br>
  <!-- Mission Overiew -->
  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
Admiral Janeway of the future travels back in time from the year 2404 to assist her former crew in escaping the Delta Quadrant. To make the journey home, Voyager must travel through a rare Borg Transwarp Hub surrounded by Borg vessels. The Admiral provides future technology and weapons that the Borg have never seen which should allow Voyager to pass through the Transwarp Hub with relative ease. But Captain Janeway of the present has other ideas. Destroying the Transwarp Hub will spare countless lives from being assimilated by the Borg, and this might take priority over the Voyager's journey home.
<br><br>
  <!-- Setup -->
  <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
  <!-- Player 1 -->
  <b>Federation Player:</b> 75 squadron points, including the U.S.S. Voyager and no other ships.
<br><br>
  <!-- Map Setup -->
  <b>Map Setup:</b> The play area for this Mission is larger than normal. Use an area 3' wide X 4' long for this Mission.
<br><br>
The Federation Player places the Voyager anywhere within 4" of her starting edge (S).
<br><br>
Place the 3 Borg Cube Tokens evenly spaced apart in a single line (E-W) 20" away from the starting edge (see diagram). Note that each segment of the Range Ruler is 4" long, so to measure 20" you can add the distance of 1 Range Ruler (12") + 2/3 the distance of 1 Range Ruler (8").
<br><br>
Place the first Transwarp Aperture Token 8" behind the central Borg Cube, centered from E-W. Place the second Transwarp Aperture Token on the far edge of the play area (N), centered from E-W. Then place the Borg Sphere equidistant between the Transwarp Apertures, centered from E-W.
<br><br>
Place the 10 Mission Tokens beside the Play Area. They will be used to mark the passing of time.
<br><br>

<!-- Special Rules -->
<b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>

Admiral Janeway's future weapons and technology were recently loaded onto Voyager and are therefore in abundance. The Borg have not yet encountered this technology and are completely vulnerable to it at the start of the Mission.
<br><br>
During this Mission, the Transphasic Torpedoes Upgrade can be fired 5 times before being discarded. Each time the Upgrade is used, place 1 Disabled Upgrade Token on the card; the Torpedo Upgrade can still be fired with these Tokens on it. When the fifth Disabled Upgrade Token is placed, discard the Transphasic Torpedoes. When firing Transphasic Torpedoes, ignore the Shields on the Borg Cubes, as well as the Transwarp Apertures; damage the Hull directly instead.
<br><br>
During this Mission, the Ablatative Generator Upgrade can receive 12 Damage Cards before being discarded (instead of 5). While a ship has an Ablative Generator Token beside it, it is immune to the Borg Cubes' Tractor Beams.
<br><br>

<b>BORG VESSELS: </b> All Borg Cubes, as well as the Borg Sphere, always have initiative. They do not move during this Mission, but they do take an Action at the start of the Activation Phase (see below), and they also fire first during the Combat Phase. Enemy ships cannot pass through a Borg Vessel. Any enemy ship that moves onto or through a Borg Vessel is immediately assimilated and destroyed. If a Borg Cube, Sphere, or Transwarp Aperture receives a Critical Hit to its Hull, do not place a face up Damage Card beside it. Instead, place 2 face down Damage Cards beside it for each Critical Hit.
<br><br>

<b>BORG CUBES:</b> Primary Weapon: 10 | Agility: 0 | Shields: 10 (ignored by Transphasic Torpedoes) | Hull: 10 | Firing Arc: 360°
<br><br>
Start of the Activation Phase
<br><br>
ACTION: Tractor Beam The Borg Cube targets the nearest enemy ship within Range 1-2 and catches that ship in the Cube's tractor beam. This ship must immediately disable all of its remaining Shields as well as its Cloak Token, if any. For the remainder of this round, the ship cannot move, cannot take Actions, and cannot fire. For all intents and purposes of this Mission, the Mission ends in failure. (Note: A ship with an Ablative Generator Token beside it is immune to this attack).
<br><br>

Start of the Combat Phase
<br><br>
Each Borg Cube can fire its Primary Weapon at any number of ships within Range 1-3.
<br><br>
End Phase
<br><br>
If two Borg Cubes are destroyed, the third Borg Cube will immediately withdraw; remove it from the Play Area.
<br><br>

<b>BORG SPHERE:</b> Primary Weapon (Cutting Beam): 6 | Agility: 1 | Hull: 6 | Shields: 6 (effective against the Transphasic Torpedoes, see below) | Firing Arc: 360°
<br><br>

Start of the Activation Phase
<br><br>

ACTION: Tractor Beam The Borg Sphere targets the nearest enemy ship within Range 1 and catches that ship in the Sphere's tractor beam. This ship must immediately disable all of its remaining Shields as well as its Cloak Token, if any. For the remainder of this round, the ship cannot move, cannot take Actions, and cannot fire. For all intents and purposes of this Mission, the Mission ends in failure. (Note: a ship with an Ablative Generator Token beside it is only partially affected by this action; see below).
<br><br>

Start of the Combat Phase
<br><br>
The Borg Sphere can fire its Primary Weapon at any number of ships within Range 1-3. The Borg Sphere has adapted to the Voyager's new weapons. Its Shields are effective against the Transphasic Torpedoes. Furthermore, its Tractor Beam works partially against the Ablative Shield Generator. A ship with an Ablative Generator Token caught in the Borg Sphere's Tractor Beam must choose a "1" maneuver during the Activation Phase, can take Actions as normal, and rolls 1 less die when attacking or defending during combat.
<br><br>

<b>TRANSWARP APERTURES</b>
<br><br>

The Transwarp Apertures do not move, attack, or take actions. If Voyager is touching a Transwarp Aperture at the end of its move, it can neither attack nor be attacked. The Transwarp Aperture has the following stats: Hull: 6 Shields: 6 (ignored by Transphasic Torpedoes). If a Transwarp Aperture is destroyed, it can no longer be traveled through.
<br><br>

<b>TRANSWARP CONDUIT AREA</b>
If Voyager ever crosses into or out of the Transwarp Conduit Area (see diagram) without passing through a functioning Transwarp Aperture, Voyager is immediately destroyed.
<br><br>
Neither Voyager nor the Borg Vessels can attack each other across the line that divides the main Play Area from the Transwarp Conduit.

<br><br><br>
  <!-- Objectives -->
  <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>

You have 10 turns to complete this Mission. Use the Mission Tokens to mark the passing of time. If Voyager is still in the Play Area at the end of the 10th Turn, it fails the Mission.
<br><br>

There are two main Objectives in this Mission:
<br>
1) If Voyager travels through both Apertures (first the South Aperture, then the North Aperture), then Voyager has made it home! Voyager needs to either pass through or end its turn on the North Aperture to complete the journey home. (3 VP)
<br>
2) If the first Transwarp Aperture is destroyed, the destruction leads to a chain reaction that destroys the entire Transwarp Hub! (6 VP)
<br><br>

If the first Aperture is destroyed before being travelled through, then Voyager cannot return home, but it can escape back into the Delta Quadrant by crossing its starting edge again. It must leave the Play Area before time runs out or the Mission will end in failure. Voyager must complete at least one of the two Objectives and then leave the Play Area or the Mission ends in failure. If Voyager can destroy the first Aperture after crossing through it, it has a chance to accomplish both Objectives. Voyager can earn even more points for this Mission if it is able to cripple the Borg further. For each Borg vessel destroyed, earn +2 Victory Points. Maximum Score Possible: 15 Victory Points

  <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
In an attempt to defeat a Species 8472 Bioship, which has proven to be impervious to Borg technology, the Borg have sacrificed one of their Cubes in order to allow an unlikely ally, a Federation ship, enough time to prepare a class 10 high yield torpedo. This weapon will be filled with modified Borg nanoprobes that should prove devas- tating to the Bioship. This will be a dangerous weapon to use and must be delivered at great range or its effects will be suffered by the Federation ship as well. If this weapon is successful, it will serve as a threat to Species 8472 and should cease their attacks.
<br><br>

Place the 6 Mission Tokens on the Federation player's Ship Card.
<br><br>

Each player , in turn places 1 Objective Token in the play area until all 4 have been placed. These tokens represent debris and are treated as Obstacles (see pg. 22 of the full Rules of Play). These tokens may not be placed within 4” of another token or any edge of the play area.
<br><br>

<!-- Special Rules -->
<b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>

<b>CLASS 10 HIGH YIELD TORPEDO</b>
* During the End Phase of each round, remove 1 Mission Token from the Federation player's Ship Card. This represents the passing of time needed to ready the class 10 high yield torpedo. When 3 Mission Tokens have been removed, the torpedo is ready to be fired. Continue to remove Mission Tokens from the Ship Card until there are none left.
<br><br>
* When the class 10 high yield torpedo is ready, instead of making a normal attack with his primary weapon during the Combat Phase, the Federation player may use the torpedo to make a 10 dice attack against the Bioship. This attack is considered a secondary weapon and requires a target lock to be spent to use it. It can be fired at Range 1-3, but if it is fired at Range 1, the Federation ship must defend against the attack as well. This attack may only be used once per game

<b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
News of Dominion forces mustering within the area of the Alpha Quadrant known as "the Badlands" has come to the attention of the Klingon Defense Force. It is your task to monitor enemy movements within this area and report your findings back to command. This is an area known for severe plasma storms and gravitational anomalies, so traversing this region of space is treacherous at best.
<br><br>
<!-- Setup -->
<b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>

<!-- Player 1 -->
<b>Dominion Player:</b> 80 SP.
<br><br>

<!-- Player 2 -->
<b>Klingon Player:</b> 50 SP, including one (and only one) ship which must be a K’Vort class ship.
<br><br>

<!-- Map Setup -->
<b>Map Setup:</b>
<br><br>

The ships are set up as in a standard 2 Player Game.
<br><br>
In addition, place the Planet Token directly in the center of the playing area.
<br><br>

Then, starting with the Klingon player, each player (in turn) places 1 of the Plasma Storm Tokens anywhere in the playing area until all 12 Plasma Storm Tokens have been placed. You may not place these tokens in either player’s starting areas.
<br><br>

NOTE: There must be at least 4” of space between any 2 Tokens.
<br><br>

<!-- Special Rules -->
<b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>

<b>GRAVITATIONAL ANOMALY</b>
<br><br>
The Planet Token represents a Gravitational Anomaly (GA). Treat this token as a Planet for purposes of movement and combat. When you are within range 1-2 of the GA, you are considered in its gravitational pull.
<br><br>
* If a ship begins the round in the gravitational pull of the GA, at the end of the Activation Phase place an Auxiliary Power Token beside that ship if that ship moves 1 range further away from the GA than its original position that round (i.e. the ship's move causes the base to be at a further range from the GA).
<br><br>
* If a ship's move causes it to enter the gravitational pull or move 1 range closer to the GA, at the end of the Activation Phase remove 1 Auxiliary Power Token.
<br><br>

NOTE: The Auxiliary Power Tokens added or removed due to the GA are in addition to any normal Auxiliary Power Tokens added or removed (i.e. from green or red maneuvers, etc.).
 
<br><br>
<b>PLASMA STORMS</b>
<br><br>
Treat these tokens as Obstacles for purposes of movement. You cannot attack through these Tokens.
<br><br>
* During the Activation Phase, if a ship's base or chosen Maneuver Template (including a Sensor Echo Template) overlaps one or more Plasma Storm Tokens, that ships suffers 1 damage for each Plasma Storm Token overlapped. This damage is applied as normal (i.e. to its Active Shields, then to its Hull).
<br><br>

<b>GATHER INTELLIGENCE AND REPORT TO COMMAND</b>
<br><br>
During the End Phase, if the Klingon ship's base touches any part of the Dominion player's starting area, place a Mission Token on the Klingon player's ship card. This represents that you've gathered the intelligence.
<br><br>
During the following round's End Phase, place a second Mission Token on top of the Klingon ship card. This represents that you've reported back to command.
<br><br><br>

<!-- Objectives -->
<b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b>
<br><br>

<b>Klingon Player:</b> If you report back to command (i.e. you've placed the 2nd Mission Token on your ship card), you win. Alternatively, you win if you destroy all enemy ships.
<br><br>

<b>Dominion Player:</b> Destroy the Klingon ship before it reports back to command.

<b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
Alidar Jarok seeks to escape the Romulan Neutral Zone in order to defect to the Federation. The Romulan Empire has given Jarok false information and secretly wants him to succeed in his escape, although they must not allow Jarok to realize this.
<br><br>
<!-- Setup -->
<b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>

<!-- Player 1 -->
<b>Romulan Empire Player:</b> 50 SP, including one Romulan ship. The Romulan Empire cannot use any additional ships.
<br><br>

<!-- Player 2 -->
<b>Romulan Defector Player:</b> 30 SP, including one Romulan Scout Vessel commanded by Alidar Jarok. The Romulan Defector cannot use any additional ships.
<br><br>

<!-- Map Setup -->
<b>Map Setup:</b>
<br><br>

The Romulan Defector must place his ship first. He must place his ship at least 4" away from the Mission's starting edge (N), but no more than 8" away from that edge. Place 3 Mission Tokens on top of the Romulan Defector's Ship Card.
<br><br>
The Romulan Empire Player places his ship next. He must place his ship within 4" of the same starting edge (N) (see diagram). Place 1 Mission Token on top of the Romulan Empire's Ship Card.
<br><br>
The Romulan Empire Player then places the Objective Token anywhere within a 4" X 8" area in the center of the opposite edge of the map (S). This Objective Token represents the safety of an awaiting Federation ship's extended shields. Neither player may fire at or through the Objective Token. Place the remaining 6 Mission Tokens in a stack beside the play area.
<br><br>

<!-- Special Rules -->
<b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>

The Romulan Defector has 6 turns to reach the safety of the awaiting Federation ship. At the end of each turn, remove 1 Mission Token from the stack beside the play area to mark the passing of time. If the last Mission Token is removed from the stack in this way, then the game ends and the Romulan Defector immediately fails the Mission.
<br><br>
If the Romulan Empire ship ever damages the Romulan Defector ship, the Romulan Empire player may, at the end of the "Modify Defense Dice" step after all other decisions have been made, choose to remove the Mission Token from his Ship Card to reduce the total damage to exactly 1 normal damage. He may only do this once per game.
<br><br>

At the end of any turn in which the Romulan Empire's ship is not within Range 2 of Alidar Jarok's ship, remove 1 Mission Token from the Romulan Defector's Ship Card. This represents Alidar Jarok being suspicious of the Romulan Empire's intentions.
<br><br>
Also, at the end of any turn in which the Romulan Empire's ship has Alidar Jarok's ship in its forward firing arc (and within range) but <b><i>chooses not to fire</i></b>, remove 1 Mission Token from the Romulan Defector's Ship Card. This also represents Alidar Jarok's growing suspicions. Note that if the Romulan Empire's ship is <b><i>unable</i></b> to fire due to a special effect, this does <b><i>not</i></b> count and the Romulan Defector does not get to remove a Mission Token.
<br><br><br>

<!-- Objectives -->
<b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b>
<br><br>

<b>Romulan Defector Player:</b> You have 6 turns to reach the Objective Token, during which time you must uncover the covert intentions of the Romulan Empire. As soon as your ship enters the Objective Token, the game ends. You then immediately roll a number of Attack Dice equal to 4 minus 1 for each Mission Token still on your Ship Card (i.e., the more tokens you have left, the worse your chances of rolling a winning result). If your ship's Shields and Hull are both completely undamaged, you win the game if you roll at least 1 Hit or Critical Hit on your Attack Dice; this represents Alidar Jarok figuring out that he has been duped. If your ship's Shield or Hull are damaged, you only win the game if you roll at least 1 Critical Hit result. If you do not roll a winning result, Alidar has been completely tricked and you fail the mission.
<br><br>

<b>Romulan Empire Player:</b> If you destroy Alidar Jarok's ship, you immediately lose the game. If Alidar Jarok's ship survives but does not reach the Objective Token in 6 turns, you win the game. If Alidar Jarok's ship reaches the Objective Token but the Defector player fails to roll a winning result, you also win the game. However, if your ship ever enters the Objective Token, you immediately lose the game

<!-- Mission Overiew -->
<b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
The Dominion is using the Bajoran Wormhole to reinforce their fleet at Cardassia with ships from the Gamma Quadrant. The Federation has devised a plan has been to prevent the constant flow of these Dominion ships into the Alpha Quadrant; a minefield made up of self- replicating mines is to be deployed at the mouth of the Wormhole.
<br><br>
<!-- Setup -->
<b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>

<!-- Player 1 -->
<b>Dominion Player:</b> Exactly 3 ships with 30 SP per ship. You may not include any unique Ships, Captains or Upgrades.
<br><br>

<!-- Player 2 -->
<b>Federation Player:</b> 60 SP, including one (and only one) ship which must be a Defiant class ship.
<br><br>

<!-- Map Setup -->
<b>Map Setup:</b>
<br><br>

The Federation ship is set up as in a standard 2-Player Game (S).
<br><br>
In addition, place the Bajoran Wormhole directly in the center of the playing area. Then, place each Objective Token, starting at the center of the side opposite the Federation player's starting area (N), so that its closest edge is exactly 4" from the Planet Token's edge and equidistant from each neighboring Objective Token.
<br><br>

The Dominion player starts with one of his chosen ships. He rolls the 6-sided die and then places one of his ships on top of the Bajoran Wormhole so that the front of its base touches the edge of the Wormhole, facing in the direction of the corresponding Objective Token (see Set Up diagram). Leave the other 2 unused ships on top of their Ship Cards.
<br><br>

<!-- Special Rules -->
<b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>

<b>DOMINION SHIPS</b>
<br><br>
The Dominion player's ships enter the playing area through the Wormhole following the Set Up rules. On each subsequent round after the first, if there are less than 3 Dominion ships in the playing area, the Dominion player adds 1 new ship to the playing area from their unused ships (i.e. there may be a maximum of 3 Dominion ships in play at any time). If a Dominion ship is destroyed, place it on top of its Ship Card.
<br><br>
<b>BAJORAN WORMHOLE TOKEN</b>
<br><br>
The Planet Token represents the Bajoran Wormhole. During the Activation Phase, if any ship's base or Maneuver Template overlaps the Wormhole it is removed from the playing area and placed on top of its Ship Card (i.e. it enters the Wormhole). NOTE: This does not apply to any Dominion ship entering the playing area that round. You may not fire through the Wormhole.
<br><br>

<b>SELF-REPLICATING MINES</b>
<br><br>

The Objective Tokens represent the target areas for deploying the self-replicating mines. When the Federation ship is within Range 1 of any of these tokens, that ship may perform the following Action:
<br><br>
ACTION: Place a Mission Token on top of any Objective Token at Range 1. This Objective Token is now considered an active minefield.
<br><br>
During the Activation Phase, if any ship's base or Maneuver Template overlaps an Active Minefield, roll 1 attack die for each Active Minefield. Any

<!-- Objectives -->
<b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b>
<br><br>

<b>Federation Player:</b> If you deploy all 6 Self-Replicating Mines, you win. If you enter the Wormhole, you lose.
<br><br>

<b>Dominion Player:</b> If you destroy the Federation ship, you win.

<b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
The Federation Alliance fleet is launching an offensive into the Chin'toka system, a territory held by the Dominion. While most of the Jem'Hadar attack ships have been sent to fight the Romulans, only a few are left to defend Chin'toka, though it was not left as undefended as the Federation Alliance thought. The Cardassians built orbital weapon platforms to defend their territories.
<br><br>
<!-- Setup -->

<!-- Player 1 -->
<b>Federation, Klingon, Romulan Player:</b> 150 SP.
<br><br>

<!-- Player 2 -->
<b>Dominion Player:</b> 150 SP, including one Jem’Hadar Attack Ship (with a Suicide Attack Upgrade) and 4 Orbital Weapon Platforms (see Special Rules cards).
<br><br>

<!-- Map Setup -->
<b>Map Setup:</b>
<br><br>

The ships are set up as in a standard 2 Player Game, except the Dominion player's starting area is 36" x 12".
<br><br>
In addition, place the Planet Token directly in the center of the playing area. Treat this as an Obstacle and use the standard rules for a Planet (see page 23 of the full Rules of Play).
<br><br>

Then, place each Objective Token, at the center of each side of the Planet Token (N, S, E & W) so that its closest edge is exactly 4" from the Planet Token's edge.
<br><br>

<!-- Special Rules -->
<b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>

<b>ORBITAL WEAPON PLATFORM (OWP)</b>
<br>
The Dominion player controls the Orbital Weapon Platform Tokens. Treat them as a single Dominion ship with the following stats:
<br><br>
Primary Weapon: 4 | Agility: 0 |Hull: 2 | Shields: 6
<br>
No Maneuvers
<br>
360 Firing Arc, Range 1-2
<br>
No Captain (Skill of "1")
<br>
75 Squadron Points (total for all 4 OWPs)
<br><br>

For every OWP Token that is destroyed, each of the remaining OWPs loses 1 Shield and rolls 1 less attack die for the rest of the game.
<br><br>

Any ship that overlaps an OWP Token at the end of its movement must move backward along its chosen Maneuver Template until it no longer overlaps the OWP Token. This ship cannot perform any Actions during that round. A ship may pass through the OWP Token the same way that it would another ship.
<br><br>
The OWP Token is not considered an obstruction for firing purposes.
<br><br>
During the End Phase of every round, each Active (non-destroyed) OWP repairs 1 Shield.
<br><br><br>

<!-- Objectives -->
<b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b>
<br><br>

<b>Dominion Player:</b> Perform a successful Suicide Attack (i.e. inflict at least 1 damage to an enemy ship using the Suicide Attack Upgrade.) Alternatively, the Dominion player can win by destroying all enemy ships.

Action even though your ship is not Cloaked and even if that Action is not listed on your ship's Action Bar.
<br><br>
*Your ship gains +2 defense dice.
<br><br>

* You cannot attack or be attacked by a ship that is outside of the Nebula. 
<br><br>

* You cannot target or be targeted by an Action on a ship that is outside the Nebula. You cannot make any attacks at Range 2-3. You still gain +1 attack die when firing at Range 1.
<br><br>
* You may fire any Secondary Weapons that can only be fired at Range 2-3 at a ship at Range 1, but you sustain damage to your ship equal to the damage you inflict minus 1. You do not take critical damage from your own attacks.
<br><br>
* Any ship that overlaps another ship at the end of its movement must move backward along its chosen Maneuver Template until it no longer overlaps the other ship. This ship cannot perform any Actions during that round. In addition, both ships must roll a number of defense dice equal to 1/2 of their Captain's Skill Number (rounded up). Each ship sustains 2 damage to its Hull, minus 1 damage for every

<br>
Hull: 8
<br>
Shields: 8
<br><br>
1) The Scimitar does not make a normal move. During the Planning Phase, shuffle the Hidden Movement Tokens (HMTS) face down and place each token face down beside a different side of the Scimitar Token. When it is the Scimitar's turn to move, flip over all of the HMTs, remove the "Echo" Tokens, and place the † 3 Maneuver Template on the side of the ship where the "Actual" Token was located. Then remove the "Actual" Token and move the Scimitar Token using that Maneuver Template. The Scimitar can never leave the play area. If a move would cause it to do so, repeat the previous steps, but remove 1 "Echo" Token and place the HMTs again, disregarding that direction.
<br><br>
2) After it moves, place a Battle Stations Token beside the ship. This token must be used when the Scimitar attacks.
<br><br>
3) If a move causes the Scimitar to overlap another ship, it must move backward along its chosen Maneuver Template until it no longer overlaps the ship. If this happens, do not place the Battle Stations Token beside the Scimitar.
<br><br>

4) The Scimitar has an advanced cloaking device that allows it to remain Cloaked with its Shields up. While it remains Cloaked, the Scimitar cannot be Target Locked, rolls 4 extra defense dice, and does not flip its Cloak Token when it fires.
<br><br>
5) While the Scimitar remains Cloaked, it rolls 1 less defense die against the second ship to attack it during a given round, and it rolls 2 less defense dice against the third and any other ships to attack it during the remainder of that round.
<br><br>
6) Once the Scimitar's Shields are destroyed, remove its
<img src='img/stuff/action_cloak.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Cloak'>
Token permanently. It can now be Target Locked and does not roll any extra defense dice. Also, it moves using the 
<img src='img/stuff/maneuver_straight.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Straight'>
2 Maneuver Template instead of the 
<img src='img/stuff/maneuver_straight.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Straight'>
3 Maneuver Template.
<br><br>
7) The Scimitar has a 360° firing arc and always attacks the nearest ship. If two ships are equidistant, the player with the Captain of the highest Skill determines which ship is attacked (if tied, the tied ship with initiative decides). Whenever the Scimitar scores a 
<img src='img/stuff/effect_crit.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Crit Result'>
against a ship's Hull, that ship must discard a random Upgrade in addition to the normal effects of the Critical Hit. If the ship does not have any Upgrades, it loses its Captain Card and is considered to have a Skill of 1 for the remainder of the game.

All of the Klingon ships have the following Actions in addition to their normal abilities:
<br><br>
ACTION: If your ship is not Cloaked, disable all of your remaining Shields and target a planet at Range 1 or a ship at Range 1-2 that is not Cloaked and has no Active Shields. Then, place a Mission Token on one of your
<img src='img/stuff/effect_crew.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Crew Upgrade'>
Upgrades and another Mission Token on top of the related planet or Ship Card. This Crew Upgrade becomes an assassin and is now considered to be on the planet or on board the targeted ship. It cannot be used for any other purpose and cannot have additional Mission Tokens assigned to it.
<br><br>
ACTION: If your ship is not Cloaked, disable all of your remaining Shields and target a planet at Range 1 with a Mission Token on it, or a ship at Range 1-2 with a Mission Token on its Ship Card that is not Cloaked and has no Active Shields. Remove your Mission Token from that planet or Ship Card, and then remove the Mission Token from your Crew Upgrade. That Crew member has now beamed back aboard your ship and is no longer considered an assassin.
<br><br>
The Klingon Player may have any number of assassins on the same planet or enemy ship.
<br><br>
During the End Phase, if the Federation player still has at least 1 Captain left on the planet, the Klingon Player rolls 1 attack die for each of his Mission Tokens on the planet. On a
<img src='img/stuff/effect_crit.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Crit Result'>
the Klingon player has assassinated one Captain of his choice on the planet and wins the game.
<br><br>
Also during the End Phase, if the Klingon player has at least 1 Mission Token on an enemy Ship Card that has its Captain back aboard, the Klingon player rolls 1 attack die for each of his Mission Tokens on that Ship Card. On a Critical Hit, the Klingon player has assassinated that Captain and wins the game.

<b>FEDERATION CAPTAINS:</b> Each Federation ship within Range 1 of the Planet Token gains the following Action:
<br><br>
ACTION: If your ship is not Cloaked, disable all of your remaining Shields to remove the Mission Token from your Captain Card. That Captain has now beamed back aboard his ship and may use his Skill Number as normal.

        <p><h3><font size="+3">Turret Turmoil</font></h3><br><br>
          <font size ="+1">Number of Players: 2 <br>
          Special Components: 4 Objective Tokens, 12 Mission Tokens <br><br>
          <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
          You've been sent on a mission to explore a newly discovered and explored sector of space that has signs of intelligent life. As you being exploring and scanning the outer rim of the sector you come upon four spherical objects that are completely smooth. Your scanners don't show anything anomalous about them, but as you approach each of them begins to open slightly. As you get closer you see a red glow appear out of each of them and they begin firing at you. It appears that each of these spheres is actually an automated sentry turret meant to defend this area! As you take evasive maneuvers to avoid any additional damage to your ship an enemy fleet appears. You must not combat the enemy fleet while also fending off the mysterious spheres!<br><br>
          <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
          <b> Both Players: </b>   130 SP per player.<br><br>
          <b> Map Setup: </b>   Each player, starting with the play with Initiative, takes turns placing the objective tokens in the play area, one at a time. Each objective token must be within 12" of the center of the play area and at least 8" from each other and from each starting area.<br><br>
          Afterwards, the players place their ships in their starting areas according to the normal Set-Up rules for two players.<br><br>
          <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
          All objective tokens represent automated sentry turrets equipped with phasers that are considered obstacles and enemy ships.<br><br>
          Each automated sentry turret has advanced hull plating and self-repair capabilities. As such, they are immune to critical effects and automatically reduce all damage dealt to them by 2. When an automated sentry turret sustains damage, use mission tokens to mark damage against them. When an automated sentry turret has three or more mission tokens on it, remove all mission tokens from it and place one time token on it. It is not in self-repair mode and cannot attack, be attacked, or be targeted for the rest of the turn. Remove all time tokens from all automated sentry turrets at the end of the turn.<br><br>
          At the end of each combat phase, each automated sentry turret that is not in self-repair mode attacks the closest ship within range 1 - 3 with 4 attack dice. Fire each automated sentry turret in ascending order based on the Captain Skill of the ship's being targeted. If it cannot be determined which ship is the closest, of those ships treat the ship with the lowest Captain Skill as the closest. If multiple ships have the same Captain Skill, of those ships, the ship whose player has Initiative is considered closest. If multiple ships are owned by the same player and have the same Captain Skill, of those ships the opposing player chooses which ship is the closest. <br><br>
          <b>END OF THE MISSION:</b><br><br>
          The mission ends when: <br><br>
          1. One player is eliminated <br><br>
          2. The time limit is reached <br><br>
          <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
          1. Destroy all your opponent's ships <br><br>
          2. Have more Fleet Points than your opponent for that Battle Round. <br>
            a. If players have the same Fleet Points for that Battle Round, one player rolls five attack dice and the other player rolls five defense dice. The player who rolls the most <img src='img/stuff/action_battlestations.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Battlestation'> results wins.<br><br>
          BONUS<br><br>
          Each time a player causes a turret to go into self-repair mode they earn +10 Fleet Points.<br><br><br>

          <font size ="+1">Number of Players: 2 <br>
          Special Components: 9 Objective Tokens: 3 Space Station, 2 Asteroid Field, 2 Derelict Ships, 2 Debris <br><br>
          <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
          While carefully traversing the treacherous terrain of the Briar Patch your ships' sensors start picking up reading of powerful energy fluctuations directly in front of your fleet. However, when brought on screen, there's absolutely nothing there. Just as your crew starts to run more in depth diagnostics an enemy fleet appears across from you behind where the sensors indicate the presence of energy fluctuations. You must fend off you enemies, but proceed with caution, the energy fluctuations may be something much more significant than they appear to be! Will you be able to defeat your enemies? Will you be able to traverse the battlefield without being affected by the energy fluctuations? Find out in this exhilarating mission!<br><br>
          <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
          <b> Both Players: </b>   130 SP per player.<br><br>
          No ship may be equipped with a mine upgrade <br>
          <b>(Cloaked Mines, Antimatter Mines, etc.)</b><br><br>
          <b> Map Setup: </b>  Shuffle the objective tokens, and place the first one face down in the center of the play area. Then, starting with the player with Initiative, the players take turns place the other objective tokens face down throughout the play area, such that they are not within range 1 of the starting areas or another objective token.<br><br>
          Afterwards, the players place their ships in their starting areas according to the normal Set-Up rules for two players.<br><br>
          <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
          Each objective token acts as a normal obstacle and represents a different type of cloaked trap that can be dangerous for any ships that end their movement near it. A ship that ends its movement within range 1 of an objective token may perfomr the following action to attempt to scan and disable the trap:<br><br>
          <b>ACTION:</b> Roll a number of defense dice equal to your current Agility Value. If you roll at least 1 <img src='img/stuff/action_evade.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Evade'> result, the trap is considered disarmed. Place the objective token on your side of the play area <b>face down</b>. You may peek at this objective token, but you do not have to share the information with the other player. <br><br>
          If the ship fails to disarm the trap, or does not attempt to disarm the trap, and the trap is still on the f ield at the end of the Activation Phase, then the trap goes off. Carefully flip the objective token over so that you may reveal its image, and consult the Trap chart below. Afterwards remove the objective token from the play area.<br><br>
          <b>NOTE:</b> If a ship ends it movement within range 1 of several traps, it can only attempt to disarm one of them. <br><br>
          TRAPS<br><br>
          1. Space Station: Make a 3 Dice Primary Weapon Attack against all ships within range 1.<br><br>
          2. Asteroid Field: All ships within range 1 sustain 2 damage. Defense dice can be rolled against this damage. <br><br>
          3. Derelict Ship: All ships within range 1 - 3 sustain 1 damage. Defense dice cannot be rolled against this damage. <br><br>
          4. Debris: All ships within range 1 sustain 1 damage to their Hull and receive an Auxiliary Power Token. Defense dice cannot be rolled against this damge. <br><br>
          <b>END OF THE MISSION:</b><br><br>
          The mission ends when: <br><br>
          1. One player is eliminated <br><br>
          2. The time limit is reached <br><br>
          <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>

          <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
          Your fleet arrives at th scene of a massacre of several ships of unknown origin. You've been tasked with recovering anything of interest from the scene in order to bolster your fleet as well as preventing any opposing factions from gathering anything potentially harmful. As you start moving through and scanning the remains of the ships, your sensors detect an approaching enemy fleet. You must recover as many of the resources as possible while fending off your foes and preventing them from doing the same! Will you succed in your venture or will you fail and let your enemies salvage potentially deadly technology to use against you in the future?<br><br>
          <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
          <b> Both Players: </b>   130 SP per player.<br><br>
          All players must use at least one resource and can use a number of resources equal to the number of ships in their fleet. This supersedes the normal rules limiting each fleet to one resource. All resources are paid for and equipped normally but start the game <b>face down</b>. A face down resource cannot be used and cannot be affected until it is discovered during the mission by analyzing one of the abandoned resource caches (see below). <br><br>
          <b> Map Setup: </b>  Place 1 objective token in the center of the play area, and place the other 2 objective tokens 8" from the east and west edges, centered from north to south.<br><br>
          Afterwards, the players place their ships in their starting areas according to the normal Set-Up rules for two players. <br><br>
          <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
          ABANDONED RESOURCE CACHES<br><br>
          Each objective token represents an abandoned resource cache, which acts as an obstacle. A ship within range 1 of one or more of these abandoned resource caches may use the following action:<br><br>
          <b>ACTION:</b> Roll 1 attack die. If a blank is rolled, nothing happens, If a
          <img src='img/stuff/action_battlestations.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Battlestation'>,

          <img src='img/stuff/effect_crit.png' style="vertical-align:middle" width='20' height='20' title='Crit Result'> is rolled, shuffle all of your face down resources under the table and randomly select one (still under the table). Flip the chosen resource face up. You may now use this resource as normal.
         <br><br>
          <b>END OF THE MISSION:</b><br><br>
          The mission ends when: <br><br>
          1. One player is eliminated <br><br>

          Special Components:<br><br>
          * 5 Objective Tokens: 2 Space Stations, 1 Asteroid Field, 1 Debris, 1 Derelict Ship<br><br>
          * 24 Mission Tokens
          <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
          Your fleet arrives in an unexplored sector of space to investigate a series of subspace anomalies causing large scale time fluctuations across the quadrant. As you arrive your sensors detect an enemy fleet coming out of warp nearby. You have direct orders to investigate the anomalies to figure out their source, but you cannot simply ignore your most hated enemies while doing so. As you engage in combat and start investigating these anomalies you realize that they are actually tears in space and time which bridge multiple universes! Will you use these anomalies to your advantage to defeat your enemies or will you try and find the source of the anomalies as quickly as possible and leave your enemy behind?<br><br>
          <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
          <b> Both Players: </b>   130 SP per player.<br><br>
          No ship may have an oversized base.<br><br>
          No ship may equip any upgrade that removes a ship from the play area (such as Warp Jump).<br><br>
          No ship may equip any upgrade that changes an enemy ship's maneuver (such as Lure, Thought Maker, or Faked Messages).<br><br>
          <b> Map Setup: </b>  Place one of the Space Station Objective Tokens face up in the center of the play area. Afterwards, shuffle the remaining objective tokens face down and hand two of them to each player (who cannot peek at them). Starting with the player with the Initiative, the players take turns place the tokens face down in the play area such that no token is within range 2 of any edge of the play area or within range 2 of any other token. Once all the tokens have been placed, carefully flip them face up, and then remove the second Space Station Objective Token so that only 4 Objective Tokens remain in the play area (1 Space Station, 1 Asteroid Field, 1 Debris, and 1 Derelict Ship). <br><br>
          Place the Mission Tokens off to one side of the play area. <br><br>
          Afterwards, the players place their ships in their starting areas per the normal Set-Up rules for two players.<br><br>
          <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
          SUBSPACE ANOMALIES<br><br>
          Each objective token represents subspace anomalies.<br><br>
          Each of the subpace anomalies is numbers:<br><br>
          1. Space Station <br><br>
          2. Derelict Ship <br><br>
          3. Asteroid Field <br><br>
          4. Debris <br><br>
          A ship that passes through one of the objective tokens is displaced into another universe. These alternate universes can only be entered by moving each of your individual ships across the objective tokens in ascending order: <br><br>
          Space Station > Derelict Ship > Asteroid Field > Debris <br><br>
          The number of mission tokens on a ship's base (see below) will indicate which universe that ship is currently in. A ship is consirdered to pass through a subspace anomaly when any part of its base or template touch the objective token.<br><br>
          When a ship passes through a subspace anomaly and the number of the objective token (see above) is exaclty one hight than the number of mission tokens on the ship's base, then immediately place one more mission token on the ship's base. If a ship passes through a subspace anomaly prematurely or passes through the same subspace anomaly a second time, there is no effect. <br><br>
          <b><font size="+1">IMPORTANT:</font></b> A ship can only affect another ship if both ships have the same number of mission tokens on their bases. <br><br>
          When an effect that places a token on the board is used (i.e. Cloaked Mines, Antimatter Mines, etc.) place a number of mission tokens on that token equal to the number of mission tokens on the base of the ship that the effect originated from. Only ships that have the same number of mission tokens on their base as the token can be affected by that token. <br><br>
          <b>END OF THE MISSION:</b><br><br>
          The mission ends when: <br><br>
          1. Any ship has four mission tokens at the end of the round. <br><br>
          2. One player is elminiated <br><br>
          3. The time limit is reached <br><br>
          <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
          1. Have the most ships with four mission tokens on their bases at the end of the game. <br>
            a. If players have the same number of ships with four missions tokens on their bases, of those tied ships, the player whose ship has the highest Captain Skill wins the mission. If the ships have the same Captain Skill, the player who has Initiative wins the mission. <br><br>
          2. Have the ship with the most mission tokens on its base at the end of the game. <br>
            a. If both players have a ship with the most mission tokens on their bases, of those tied ships, the player whose ship has the highest Captain Skill wins the mission. If the ships have the same Captain Skill, the player who has Initiative wins the mission.<br><br>
          3. Destroy all your opponent's ships. <br><br>
          4. Have more Fleet Points than your opponent for that Battle Round.<br>

          Special Components:<br><br>
          2 Objective Tokens, 3 Mission Tokens<br><br>
          <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
          An enemy fleet waits to ambush your ship as you complete the end of the third segment of the Antarian Trans-stellar Rally, a race that covers 2.3 billion kilometers through obstacles that include dwarf star clusters and K-class anomalies.<br><br>
          <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
          <b> Both Players: </b>   130 SP per player.<br><br>
          <b> Map Setup: </b><br>
          * Place 1 Objective Token in the play area, centered from E to W so that there is exactly 12" between it and the N edge of the play area.<br><br>
          * Place 1 Objective Token in the play area, centered from E to W so that there is exactly 12" between it and the S edge of the play area. <br><br>
          * The players then set up using the Standard 2-Player Rules (see page 6 of the Full Rules of Play) with the following exceptions: <br><br>
          - Player 1 sets their Racer <i>(see below)</i> in a 4" x 4" area along the E edge of the play area (which starts exactly 12" from the N edge) and all of their other ships in a 4" x 12" area in the NW corner of the play area. <br><br>
          - Player 2 sets their Racer <i>(see below)</i> in a 4" x 4" area along the E edge of the play area (which starts exactly 12" from the S edge) and all of their other ships in a 4" x 12" area in the SW corner of the play area. <br><br>
          * Place 3 Mission Tokens in a stack beside the play area. At the end of each End Phase, remove on Mission Token from the stack.<br><br>
          <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
          RACER<br><br>
          * Each fleet must include 1 ship that is considered to be its "Racer". These ships must have a Hull Value of 3 or less. <br><br>
          * During Set Up, neither players' Racer can be facing directly N nor directly S and must be facing part of the W edge of the play area. <br><br>
          - To determine if a ship is facing the W edge, choose one side of the ship's base. For this purpose, the side of the base extends all the way to the edge of the play area. If the lines goes through the W edge, it is considered to be facing the W edge. <br><br>
          * During the Planning Phase, a Racer cannot choose a maneuver on its Maneuver Dial with a speed greater than 3 until: <br><br>
          1) One or both Racers have crossed the finish line, OR <br><br>
          2) There are no Mission Tokens left in the stack. <br><br>
          CROSSING THE FINISH LINE <br><br>
          The Objective Tokens and the space between the Objective Tokens represent the finish line. These are not Obstacles and are treated only as points in space. <br><br>
          When a ship executes a maneuver in which either the Maneuver Template or the ship's base physically overlaps one of the Objective Tokens or the space between then Objective Tokens, it is considered to have crossed the finish line. <br><br>
          NOTE: If a ship ends up beyond the Objective Tokens, but neither its Maneuver Template nor its base overlapped the finish line, that ship is considered to have not crossed the finish line. <br><br>
          WINNING THE RACE <br><br>
          Only a ship that crosses the finish line can be considered the winner of the race. The winner o the race is determined in one of 2 ways: <br><br>
          1) If one Racer crosses the finish line and the other does not, the ship that crossed the finish line is considered  to be the winner, OR <br><br>
          2) If both Racers cross the finish line in the same round, the Racer that ends its move closer to the W edge of the play area is considered to be the winner. <br><br>
          The winning Racer immediately places an <b>[Evade]</b> Token beside its ship. <br><br>
          AMBUSHING FLEET <br><br>
          Neither player's ships (other than their Racers) can do anything until: <br><br>
          1) Their Racer has crossed the finish line, OR <br><br>
          2) The last Mission Token is removed from the stack. <br><br>
          Once a player's Racer crosses the finish line, that player may use the rest of their ships as normal. <br><br>

          <font size ="+1">Number of Players: 2 <br>
          Special Components:<br><br>
          1 Planet Token, 12 Mission Tokens<br><br>
          <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
          While attempting to obtain new technology from a ship that is in an orbital facility near a gas giant in the Vintaak system, your fleet is set upon by an enemy fleet. As the battle progresses, the Tholian ships in the area begin to form their energy web around your fleets.<br><br>
          Can you evade the Tholian Web and defeat your opponent? <br><br>
          <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
          <b> Both Players: </b>   130 SP per player.<br><br>
          <b> Map Setup: </b><br>
          * Place a Planet Token centered from N to S so that there is exactly 4" between it and the E edge of the play area.<br><br>
          * Place one Mission Token in the NW corner of the play area, so that there is exactly 12" between it and the N edge of the play area and exactly 4" between it and the W edge of the play area. <br><br>
          * Place one Mission Token in the SW corner of the play area, so that there is exactly 12" between it and the S edge of the play area and exactly 4" between it and the W edge of the play area. <br><br>
          * The players then set up using the Standard 2-Player rules <i>(see pg. 6 of the Rules of Play)</i>.<br><br>
          <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
          GAS GIANT<br><br>
          The Planet Token represents the gas giant. Treat this as a regular Planet Token <i>(see pg. 23 of the Rules of Play)</i> with the following exceptions: <br><br>
          * Any ship that executes a maneuver in which the Maneuver Template overlaps the gas giant suffers one damage. <br>
          * Any ship that overlaps the gas giant at the end of its movement must back up along its Maneuver Template as normal and suffers two additional damage. The ship also skips the "Perform Action" step as normal. <br><br>
          THOLIAN SHIPS <br><br>
          The Mission Tokens represent the Tholian ships. These tokens cannot attack or be attacked, cannot move or perform Actions, and cannot be affected in any way. <br><br>
          At the end of each game round, starting with the player whose ship has the highest Captain Skill (resolve ties normally), each player places another Mission Token in the play area with the following restrictions. The new Tokens: <br><br>
          1) Must be placed within Range 1 of another Mission Token that was already in the play area at the start of the round, <br>
          AND <br>
          2) Cannot be placed within Range 1 of any ship or the Planet Token. <br><br>
          THOLIAN WEB <br><br>
          At the end of every Activation Phase, after all ships have moved, check for damage to ships from the Tholian Web. <br><br>
          Place the Range Ruler between two Mission Tokens within Range 3 of each other, measuring the closest distance between them. If the Range Ruler overlaps a ship's base, that ship suffers one damage. <br><br>
          Repeat this process for every set of two Mission Tokens that are within Range 3 of each other. <br><br>
          NOTE: A ship may suffer more than one damage in a round if it lies between multiple sets of Mission Tokens, that are within Range 3 of each other. <br><br>
          <i> For Example: <br><br>
            A ship finds itself amongst three Mission Tokens that are within Range 3 of each other. <br><br>
            The Range Ruler is placed between Mission Token A and Mission Token B. The Range Ruler overlaps the ship's base, so the ship suffers one damage. <br><br>
            The Range Ruler is then placed between Mission Token B and Mission Token C. The Range Ruler overlaps the ship's base, so the ship suffers one additional damage. <br><br>
            The Range Ruler is then placed between Mission Token A and Mission Token C. The Range Ruler does not overlap the ship's base, so the ship does not suffer any additional damage. </i> <br><br>
            THE GAME ENDS WHEN one player is eliminated of the time limit is reached. <br><br>
          <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
          Destroy all of your opponent's ships.<br><br>
          <b>Bonus:</b> At the end of the game, each player receives +10 Fleet Points for each opposing ship that was destroyed by damage from the Tholian Web. <br><br><br>

          Special Components:<br><br>
          1 Objective Token <br><br>
          <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
          Your fleet has encounterd a damaged ship from the past that has emerged from a strange temporal rift. While repairing it, you realize that this ship has caused your timeline to be altered and have determined that it must return through the rift to its own time to set things right. As your fleet escourts the damaged ship back to the rift, you are set upon by an enemy fleet.<br><br>
          Will you successfully return the damaged ship to its own  time? Or will the ship be destroyed on route to the rift, leaving you stuck in this alternate timeline? <br><br>
          <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
          <b> Both Players: </b>   130 SP per player.<br><br>
          <b> Map Setup: </b><br>
          * Place an Objective Token centered N to S so that it touches the E edge of the play area.<br><br>
          * The players then set up using the Standard 2-Player rules <i>(see pg. 6 of the Rules of Play)</i> with the following exceptions:<br><br>
          * Player 1 must place his/her damaged ship <i>(see below)</i> in a 4" x 4" area in the NW corner of the play area. Player 1 then sets up the rest of his/her fleet in an 8" x 15" area in the NW corner of the play area. <br><br>
          * Player 2 must place his/her damaged ship <i>(see below)</i> in a 4" x 4" area in the SW corner of the play area. Player 2 then sets up the rest of his/her fleet in an 8" x 15" area in the SW corner of the play area. <br><br>
          <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
          TEMPORAL RIFT <br><br>
          The Objective Token represents the Temporal Rift. When a ship executes a maneuver in which either the Maneuver Template or the ship's base physically overlaps the Objective Token that ship is considered to have entered the rift and is immediately removed from the play area for the rest of the game. <br><br>
          In addition, if a ship extis the play area within Range 1 of the Objective Token, it is also considered to have entered the rift and is immediately removed from the play area for the rest of the game. <br><br>
          DAMAGED SHIPS <br><br>
          One ship in each player's fleet is considered to be the damaged ship that is attempting to enter the temporal rift. Place Critical Hit Tokens beside both of these ships. These tokens cannot be removed for the duration of the game.<br><br>
          The damaged ship: <br><br>
          1) May only have a Hull value of 4 or less. <br><br>
          2) May not execute a maneuver with a speed greater than 3. <br><br>
          3) Must be assigned a Captain and may only be equipped with one Upgrade card with a printed cost of 5 SP or less. NOTE: This Upgrade's ability cannot allow the damaged ship to be removed from the play area or execute an additional maneuver. <br><br>
          4) Begins the game with one damage to its Hull. Take one damage card from the Damage Deck and place it beside the ship's Ship Card. <br><br>
          5) May transfer a number of damage that receives from an attack to a friendly ship that is within Range 1 of the damaged ship equal to the friendly ship's remaining Shields. Any excess damage hits the damaged ship as normal. <br><br>
          TEMPORAL DISPLACEMENT <br><br>
          At the start of the game, during the Gather Forces step, each player must flip 1/2 of the Upgrades assigned to each of his/her ships face down <i>(round up)</i>. These Upgrades cannot be used until that player's damaged ship enters the temporal rift <i>(see above)</i>. This does not apply to an Upgrade assigned to the player's damaged ship. <br><br>
          Once a player's damaged ship enters the rift, immediately flip all of that player's face down cards face up. Those cards are usable immediately. <br><br>
          <i>For Example: Player 1 has the U.S.S. Enterprise-D with the Jadzia Dax Crew Upgrade and a Photon Torpedeo Weapon Upgrade assigned to it face down. That player's damaged ship move before the Enterprise-D and has entered the temporal rift, so both the Jadzia Dax and Photo Torpedo Upgrade cards are flipped face up. When the Enterprise-D moves this turn it may use Jadzia Dax's Action to perform an additional 2 forward or bank maneuver and during the Combat Phase, it may fire the Photon Torpedo Upgrade as normal. </i><br><br>
          In addition, when a player's damaged ship enters the rift, remove all Disabled Upgrade Tokens from on top of all of that Player's Upgrade cards. <br><br>
          NOTE: An Upgrade card that is flipped face up cannot add Upgrade slot(s) to its ship. <br><br>
          THE GAME ENDS WHEN one player is eliminated or the time limit is reached. <br><br>
          <b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
          Destroy all of your opponent's ships.<br><br>
          <b>Bonus:</b> At the end of the game, each player whose damaged ship enters the temporal rift gains +10 Fleet Points. <br><br>
          <b>Bonus:</b> At the end of the game, each player gains +10 Fleet Points for destroying their opponent's damaged ship. <br><br><br>

	<font size ="+1">Number of Players: 2 <br>
				Special Components:<br><br>
				1 Planet Token <br><br>
				<b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
				The Rite of Succession has ben completed and Gowron is named the new leader of the Klingon High Council. After boarding his flagship, Gowron prepares to leave Qo'noS, but is immediately set upon by an enemy fleet. The House of Duras does not agree with the decision of the Arbiter of Succession and attempts to kill Gowron. <br><br>
				Will they succeed? Or will Gowron's fleet thwart the assassination attempt?<br><br>
				<b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
				<b> Both Players: </b>   130 SP per player.<br><br>
				<b> Map Setup: </b><br>
				* Place the Planet Token directly in the center of the play area. <br><br>
				* The players then set up using the Standard 2-Player Rules <i>(see page 6 of the Full Rules of Play).</i><br><br><br>
				<b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
				KLINGON FLEET <br><br>
				Each player must include at least 1 Klingon Card <i>(Ship, Captain, Admiral or Upgrade)</i> in his/her fleet. <br><br>
				Every ship in a player's fleet costs -2 SP if that ship is either: <br><br>
				1) A Klingon ship <br><br>
				OR <br><br>
				2) A non-Klingon ship with at least one Klingon card assigned to it. <br><br>
				NOTE: This cose reduction is not cumulative. The maximum cost reduction per ship is -2 SP> <br><br>
				PLANET TOKEN <br><br><br>
				This token represents Qo'noS. Treat this as a regular Planet Token <i>(see pg. 23 of the Rules of Play)</i>. <br><br><br>
				GOWRON <br><br>
				Each player must have Gowron assigned to a ship in his/her fleet. This can be accomplished in one of two ways: <br><br>
				1) COVERTLY: Prior to the start of the game, before any ships are set up, the player secretly records on a separate sheet of paper which ship in his/her fleet has Gowron assigned to it. There are no penalties, special abilities, or bonuses gained by Gowron being covertly assigned to a ship. <br><br>
				If this method is used, no Gowron card is physically assigned to a ship in that player's fleet, but Gowron is considered to be aboard that ship. <br><br>
				OR <br><br>
				2) OPENLY: The player assigns a Gowron Captain or Admiral Card to one of the ships in his/her fleet. <br><br>
				If this method is used, there is no cost for the Gowron Captain or Admiral Card. <br><br><br>
				TRANSFERRING GOWRON <br><br>
				During the Activation Phase, a ship that has Gowron aboard it may perform one of the following Actions to transfer Gowron to another ship in his/her fleet: <br><br>
				<b>ACTION:</b> If Gowron is OPENLY aboard your ship and your ship is not Cloaked and has no Active Shields, target a friendly ship at Range 1 - 2 that is not Cloaked and has no Active Shields. Remove the Gowron Card from your ship and assign it to the target ship. If the Gowron Card is a Captain Card and there is another Captain Card already on the target ship, that ship must flip the Captain Card face down and use the Gowron Card as its new Captain. Your ship now has a Captain Skill of "1". <br><br>
				NOTE: If the target ship has an "Injured Captain" and/or a "Communications Failure" Critical Damage card assigned to it, those cards are flipped face down as well. <br><br>
				OR <br><br>
				<b>ACTION:</b> If Gowron is COVERTLY aboard your ship and your ship is not Cloaked and has no Active Shields, target a friendly ship at Range 1 - 2 that is not Cloaked and has no Active Shields. Gowron is now considered to be aboard that ship. You must adjust the separate sheet of paper to record this change. <br><br>
				NOTE: If this Action is used, Gowron is now considered to be "Openly" aboard the new ship for purposes of End Game scoring. <br><br><br>
				THE GAME ENDS WHEN one player is eliminated or the time limit is reached. <br><br><br>
				<b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
				Destroy all of your opponent's ships.<br><br>
				<b>Bonus:</b> If a player destroys an opponent's ship with Gowron OPENLY aboard, at the end of the game, that player gains +10 Fleet Points. <br><br>
				<b>Bonus:</b> If a player destroys an opponent's ship with Gowron COVERTLY aboard, at the end of the game, that player gains +20 Fleet Points. <br><br><br>

					<p><h3><font size="+3">The Trouble With Tribbles</font></h3><br><br>
					<font size ="+1">Number of Players: 2 <br>
								Special Components:<br><br>
								1 Planet Token & 24 Mission Tokens <br><br>
								<b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
								While heading towards the disputed Sherman's Planet after a shore leave on Deep Space Station K7, your fleet is set upon by an enemy fleet that was also at the space station. Both fleets have brought some tribbles on board their ships from the station. <br><br>
								Will the small creatures cause problems for yourfleet during the battle? Or will they help your ships to achieve victory?<br><br>
								<b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
								<b> Both Players: </b>   130 SP per player.<br><br>
								<b> Map Setup: </b><br>
								* Place the Planet Token directly in the center of the play area. <br>
								* Place 24 Mission Tokens in a pile beside the play area. These Tokens represent Tribbles <i>(see below)</i>. NOTE: They are considered to be an infinite number of Tokens in this pile. If at any time there are not enough Tokens in this pile, add more Tokens to the pile.<br>
								* The players then set up using the Standard 2-Player Rules <i>(see page 6 of the Rules of Play)</i> with the following additional rules: <br><br>
								- Each player must take 2 Mission Tokens from beside the play area and place them on 1 or 2 of his/her Ship Cards. A player may place: <br>
								- Both Tokens on 1 Ship Card, <br>
								OR <br>
								- 1 Token each on 2 different Ship Cards. <br><br>
								<b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
								PLANET TOKEN <br><br>
								This token represents Sherman's Planet. Treat this as a regular Planet Token <i>(see pg. 23 of the Rules of Play)</i>. <br><br><br>
								TRIBBLES <br><br>
								The Mission Token represents Tribbles. When a Tribble Token is on a Ship Card, it is considered to be aboard that ship. <br><br>
								During the End Phase of each round, add 1 Tribble Token from the pile beside the play area to each ship that already has at least 1 Tribble Token aboard it. <br><br>
								Tribble Tokens affect players' ships as follows: <br><br>
								* While there are 1 or 2 Tribble Tokens aboard a ship, that ship rolls +1 attack die each time it attacks and +1 defense die each time it defends. <br>
								* While there are 3 or 4 Tribble Tokens aboard a ship, there is no effect. <br>
								* While there are 5 or more Tribble Tokens aboard a ship, that ship rolls -1 attack die each time it attacks and -1 defense die each time it defends. <br>
								* If a ship with any number of Tribble Tokens aboard it includes any Klingon Captains or <b>[Crew]</b> Upgrades, that ship cannot perform any free Actions and must place an Auxiliary Power Token beside it if it executes a maneuver with a speed of 3 or higher. <br>
								* A ship that has at least 1 Tribble Token aboard it gains the following Actions: <br><br>
								<b>ACTION:</b> If your ship is not Cloaked, disable all of your remaining Shields and target a ship at Range 1 - 2 that is not Cloaked and has no Active Shields. Place any number of your Tribble Tokens on the target ship's Ship Card. <br>
								OR <br>
								<b>ACTION:</b> If your ship is not Cloaked, disable all of your remaining Shields and target the Planet Token at Range 1 - 2. Place any number of your Tribble Tokens back in the pile beside the play area. Then place 1 Critical Hit Token beside your Ship Cards. <br><br>
								When using either of these Actions, a ship cannot transfer any Tribble Token(s) that it recieved that round. <br><br>
								THE GAME ENDS WHEN one player is eliminated or the time limit is reached. <br><br><br>
								<b><u>OBJECTIVES</u></b><br><br>
								Destroy all of your opponent's ships.<br><br>
								<b>Bonus:</b> At the end of the game, the player with the fewest Critical Hit Tokens beside his/her Ship Cards gains +20 Fleet Points. <br><br><br>

                      <b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
                       While mapping an unexplored region of space, an unidentified object approaches your fleet at light speed, but it slows down as it nears your ships. As you attempt to move away from it, it follows your every move and won’t let you escape. You determine that it is a space buoy and quickly learn that it is emitting a radiation that is harmful to your ships. You must find a way to escape it or destroy it. <br><br>
                      Suddenly, you are set upon by an enemy fleet. The enemy ships seem to have the same problems with the buoy. Will your fleet survive the deadly radiation as well as the attacks from the enemy fleet? <br><br>
              
                       <b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>

                       <b> Map Setup: </b><br>
                       * Place the Objective Token directly in the center of the play area. <br>
                       * The players then set up using the Standard 2-Player Rules <i>(see page 6 of the Rules of Play)</i> <br><br>
              
                       <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
                       SPACE BUOY <br><br>
                       The Ojbective Token represents the Space Buoy. Treat the Space Buoy as an Obstacle <i>(see pg. 22 of the Rules of Play)</i> with the following exception: <br><br>
                       * Instead of rolling for damage, any ship that overlaps or is overlapped by the buoy automatically suffers 1 critical damage and places an Auxiliary Power Token beside it. <br><br>
              
              NOTE: This Auxiliary Power Token is in addition to any Auxiliary Power Tokens placed because of the harmful radiation <i>(see below)</i>.
              
               <br><br>
                       In addition, every round, at the end of each End Phase, the buoy will move towards the nearest ship from either fleet. <br><br>
              * Using a <b>2 [straight]</b> Maneuver Template, move the buoy towards the closest point of the nearest ship’s base. NOTE: This may be a different ship every round. <br><br>
              * If the buoy overlaps the ship’s base, move it backward along its Maneuver Template until it no longer overlaps the ship’s base. <br><br>
              
              HARMFUL RADIATION <br><br>
              
              After the buoy moves, place an Auxiliary Power Token beside every ship that is within Range 1 of the buoy. <br><br>
              
              The ship that is nearest to the buoy must disable 1 Active Shield Token as well, if possible. If that ship is Cloaked, it must flip its <b>[Cloak]</b> Token over to its red side. <br><br>
              
              SHOCKWAVE <br><br>
              
              The Space Buoy can be attacked and destroyed. <br><br>
              * Any round in which the buoy receives 6 or more damage from one or more attacks, it is destroyed. <br><br>
              * If this happens, the nearest ship within Range 1 of the buoy suffers 3 damage and all other ships within Range 1 of the buoy suffer 2 damage. <br><br>
              * Once the damage is inflicted, remove the Objective Token from the play area. <br><br>
              
              If the buoy receives less than 6 damage in a round, it is completely repaired and the damage cards are removed during the End Phase. <br><br>
              
              THE GAME ENDs WHEN on player is eliminated or the time limit is reached.
              <br><br><br>
                      <b><u>OBJECTIVE</u></b><br><br>
                      Destroy all of your opponent's ships.<br><br>
              
                      <b>Bonus:</b> At the end of the game, a player gains +10 Fleet Points if the Space Buoy is destroyed and an opposing ship was the nearest ship to it within Range 1 when it was destroyed. <br><br><br>

                      Following the path of the Vega Nine probe, your fleet has travelled to the Beta Stromgren star system in order to try to make contact with an alien organism referred to as “Tin Man”. Tin Man appears to be a “living” starship orbiting a star that is going to super nova. As you ready yourselves to make contact, your fleet is set upon by an enemy fleet which is also trying to make contact with Tin man. <br><br>
                      
                      Will you be the first to make contact? <br><br>

                      <b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
                      STAR <br><br>
                      The Planet Token represents a star. It is a complete obstruction for firing purposes and any ship that overlaps the star at the end of its movement is destroyed. <br><br>
                      
                      TIN MAN <br><br>
                      The Objective Token represents “Tin Man”. Treat this Token as a ship with the following stats: <br>
                      Primary Weapon: 0 <br>
                      Agility: 0 <br>
                      Hull: 5 <br>
                      Shields: 5 <br><br>
                      
                      Tin Man cannot move, perform Actions or attack, but if it is attacked, it immediately retaliates against the attacking ship by emitting an energy wave. <br><br>
                      
                      * Roll 6 attack dice. The attacking ship suffers normal damage for every <b>[Hit]</b> or <b>[Critical Hit]</b> result from these dice. <br><br>
                      * Then roll 3 attack dice. Every other ship within Range 1-2 of Tin Man suffers normal damage for every <b>[Hit]</b> or <b>[Critical Hit]</b> result from these dice. <br><br> 
                      
                      If an attack is made withing Range 1-2 of Tin Man (i.e. either the attacking or defending ship is within Range 1-2 of Tin Man) an energy wave is also emitted from Tin Man. <br><br>
                      
                      * Roll 2 attack dice. Every ship within Range 1-2 of Tin Man suffers normal damage for every <b>[Hit]</b> or <b>[Critical Hit]</b> <br><br>
                      
                      NOTE: Ships cannot defend against the energy waves emitted from Tin Man. <br><br>
                      
                      MAKING CONTACT <br><br>
                      
                      If one of your ships is within Range 1 of Tin Man performs a <b>[Scan]</b> Action, instead of placing a <b>[Scan]</b> Token beside it, you may place a Mission Token on that ship’s Ship Card. <br><br>
                      
                      A ship withing Range 1 of Tin Man may perform the following Action: <br>
                      <b>ACTION:</b> Roll 1 attack die for each Mission Token on your Ship Card. If you roll at least 2 <b>[Hit]</b> results you have made contact with Tin Man. Remove all of the Mission Tokens from that Ship Card and place 1 of them beside your Ship Cards. This represents that your fleet has made contact with Tin Man. <br><br>

                      While you are battling with an enemy fleet, an alien probe enters your sector.

                      THE ALEIN PROBE <br><br>
                      The Objective Token represents the Alien Probe as it moves across the play area towards the Earth. Treat this as a ship that does not perform any Actions, cannot attack or be attacked, and cannot be affected by the player’s ships in any way. <br><br>
                      
                      Each round at the end of every End Phase, the Alien Probe moves in a straight line across the play area until it exits through the W edge of the play area. <br><br>
                      
                      To move the Alien Probe, place a 2 <b>[straight]</b> Maneuver Template next to the edge of the Objective Token that is nearest to the W edge of the play area. While holding the template in place; lift the Objective Token off the play surface. Then place it at the opposite end of the template, so that the edge of the Token that is nearest to the E edge of the play area touches the template. NOTE: The Objective Token should remain centered N to S at all times. <br><br>
                      
                      If the Alien Probe overlaps another ship’s base that ship is destroyed immediately. <br><br>
                      POWER DRAIN <br><br>
                      
                      The Alien Probe drains the power from ships that are too close to it as follows: <br><br>
                      
                      DURING THE PLANNING PHASE: <br>
                      * A ship that is within Range 2 of the Alien Probe at the start of the planning phase cannot choose a maneuver from its Maneuver Dial that has a speed greater than 2. <br>
                      * A ship that is within Range 1 of the Alien Probe at the start of the Planning Phase does not choose a maneuver and cannot move. <br><br>
                      
                      DURING THE ACTIVATION PHASE: <br>
                      * If a ship executes a maneuver that would cause the final position of its base to end within Range 2 of the Alien Probe, the ship loses its “Perform Action” step. <br>
                      * If a ship executes a maneuver that would cause the final position of its base to end within Range 1 of the Alien Probe, the ship places Auxiliary Power Token beside it and loses its “Perform Action” step. <br>
                      * If a ship executes a maneuver that would cause the final position of its base to overlap the Alien Probe, move the Active ship backward along the top of the template until it no longer overlaps the Alien Probe. The ship then suffers 2 damage, places Auxiliary Power Token beside it, and loses its “Perform Action” step <br><br>
                      
                      DURING THE COMBAT PHASE: <br>
                      * Any attacks made by a ship within Range 2 of the Alien Probe are made at -2 attack dice. Each time a ship within Range 2 of the Alien Probe defends, it rolls 1 less defense die. <br>
                      * A ship that is within Range 1 of the Alien Probe cannot attack or defend. In addition, a cloaked ship within Range 1 of the Alien Probe must flip its [Cloak] Token over to its red side. <br><br>
                      
                      DURING THE END PHASE: <br>
                      * A ship within Range 2 of the Alien Probe can only flip up to 2 of its Disabled Shield Tokens (red) back to their Active sides (blue). <br>
                      * A ship within Range 1 of the Alien Probe cannot flip any of its Disabled Shield Tokens (red) back to their Active sides (blue). <br><br>
                      
                      THE GAME ENDS WHEN: <br>
                      1) One player is eliminated, OR <br>
                      2) The Alien Probe exits the play area through the W edge of the play area, OR <br>
                      3) The time limit is reached. <br><br><br>
                      <b><u>OBJECTIVE</u></b><br><br>

<font size ="+1">
Number of Players: 2 <br>
Special Components: 1 Planet Token and Mission Tokens.
<br><br>

<b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
The Genesis planet was created when Khan Noonien Singh detonated the Genesis Device in the Mutara Sector in an attempt to kill Admiral James T. Kirk. The planet is growing very rapidly and you have sent an away team to the planet’s surface to study it. While your away team is on the planet, your fleet is set upon by an enemy fleet who has sent its own away team to the planet’s surface. Can you retrieve your away team before the volatile planet or the enemy’s away team destroys them?
<br><br>

<b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
<b> Both Players: </b>   130 SP per player. <br><br>
<b> Map Setup: </b><br>
* Place the Planet Token directly in the center of the play area. <br>
* The players then set up using the Standard 2- Player Rules (see page 6 of the Full Rules of Play) with the following exception: <br><br>

* Player 1 must place one of his/her ships to the N of the Planet Token, within Range 1 of the Planet Token. <br>

* Player 2 must place one of his/her ships to the S of the Planet Token, within Range 1 of the Planet Token. <br>

* Neither of these ships may start E or W of the Planet Token (i.e. no part of either ships’ base may be closer to the E or W edges of the play area than the Planet Token). <br>

* Each player then places his/her Away Team cards beside his/her Ship Cards (see below). <br>


<b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
THE GENESIS PLANET <br><br>
Treat this as a regular Planet Token <i>(see page 23 in the Rules of Play)</i>. Any ship within Range 1-2 of the Genesis planet may perform the following Action: <br><br>
<b>ACTION:</b> If your ship is not Cloaked, disable all of your remaining Shields and then remove 1 of the members of your Away Team from the planet (i.e. the stack of <b>[Crew]</b> Upgrades beside your Ship Cards) and deploy it to your ship, even if it exceeds your ship’s restrictions. Place 1 Mission Token beside your Ship Cards. <br><br>
The volatile nature of the Genesis Planet may cause damage to your ships and/or your Away Teams. At the end of each End Phase: <br><br>
1) Each ship within Range 1 of the Planet Token rolls 2 attack dice and suffers 1 damage for each <b>[Hit]</b> or <b>[Critical Hit]</b> result.

2) Each player rolls a number of defense dice equal to the number of members left in its Away Team. If a player rolls at least 1 <b>[Evade]</b> result, that player’s Away Team is safe. Otherwise, that player must remove 1 member of its Away Team from the game. <br><br>

AWAY TEAM <br><br>
At the start of the game, during the Gather Forces step of Setup, each player must choose an additional 6 <b>[Crew]</b> Upgrades and place them in a stack beside his/her Ship Cards. These cards are the members of both players’ Away Teams. While these cards are in this stack, they are considered to be on the planet and cannot use any of the text abilities listed on their cards. NOTE: These cards are in addition to the normal Fleet Build for this event and the total SP for all 6 of these cards cannot exceed 24 SP. <br><br>
During the Combat Phase, when it is a ship’s turn to attack, if the ship is within Range 1-2 of the Genesis Planet, that ship’s player may choose to forego that ship’s attack and instead attack with his Away Team. <br><br>
The attacker rolls 1 attack die for each member of his Away Team (max 2). The defender then rolls 1 defense die for each member of his Away Team (max 2). <br><br>
For each un-canceled <b>[Hit]</b> or <b>[Critical Hit]</b> result, the defending player must remove 1 member of his/her Away Team from the game (defender’s choice). <br><br>
NOTE: A ship does not have to have an opponent in its firing arc to forego its attack. <br><br>

THE GAME ENDS WHEN one player is eliminated or the time limit is reached. <br><br><br>
<b><u>OBJECTIVE</u></b><br><br>
Destroy all of your opponent's ships.<br><br>

<b>Bonus:</b> At the end of the game, each player gains + 5 Fleet Points for each Mission Token beside that player’s Ship Cards (i.e. each Away Team member that was retrieved from the planet). <br><br>
<b>Bonus:</b> At the end of the game, the player with the most Mission Tokens beside his/her Ship Cards gains an additional + 10 Fleet Points.

Number of Players: 2 <br>
Special Components: None.
<br><br>

<b><u>MISSION OVERVIEW</u></b><br><br>
Your fleet encounters an enemy fleet outside of the Mutara Nebula. Being made up of mostly ionized gases, the static discharges contained within this interstellar dust cloud will not allow your ships’ sensors and shields to function properly while they are within the nebula. It will take high levels of skill, experience and intelligence to do battle within such an environment. Will your fleet have what it takes to enter into such a battle?
<br><br>

<b><u>SETUP</u></b><br><br>
<b> Both Players: </b>   130 SP per player. <br><br>
<b> Map Setup: </b><br>
The players set up using the Standard 2- Player Rules (see page 6 of the Full Rules of Play) with the following exception: <br><br>

* The starting area for Player 1 is a 12” x 4” area in the NE corner along the N edge of the play area. <br><br>

* The starting area for Player 2 is a 12” x 4” area in the SE corner along the S edge of the play area. <br><br><br>


<b><u>SPECIAL RULES</u></b><br><br>
OPEN SPACE <br>
The 12” x 36” area along the E edge of the play area (i.e. the players’ starting areas and the 12” x 28” area between them) is considered “open space”. <br><br>
A ship that is in open space cannot: <br>
1) Attack of be attacked by a ship that is inside the Mutara Nebula. <br>
2) Target Lock a ship that is inside the Mutara Nebula. <br>
3) Target or be targeted by an Action or text ability on a ship that is inside the Mutara Nebula. <br>

THE MUTARA NEBULA <br>
The 24” x 36” area along the W edge of the play area is considered to be part of the Mutara Nebula. A ship is considered to be inside the Nebula if any part of its base is within this area. <br><br>
While inside the Nebula: <br>
1) A ship must immediately disable all of its Shields and discard its <b>[Cloak]</b> Token, if any, upon entering the Nebula. A ship cannot enable its Shields during the End Phase while that ship remains inside the Nebula. <br><br>

2) A ship cannot perform the <b>[Target Lock]</b>, <b>[Scan]</b>, or <b>[Cloak]</b> Actions. <br><br>

3) A ship may perform the <b>[Sensor Echo]</b> Action if that ship performed a Maneuver with a speed of 3 or less, even though that ship is not Cloaked and even if the <b>[Sensor Echo]</b> Action is not listed on that ship’s Action Bar. <br><br>

A ship that performed a maneuver with a speed of 1 may use a 1, 2 or 3 <b>[Straight]</b>Maneuver Template when performing the <b>[Sensor Echo]</b> Action. <br><br>

A ship that performed a maneuver with a speed of 2 may use a 1 or 2 <b>[Straight]</b> Maneuver Template when performing the <b>[Sensor Echo]</b> Action. <br><br>

A ship that performed a maneuver with a speed of 3 may use a 1 <b>[Straight]</b> Maneuver Template when performing the <b>[Sensor Echo]</b> Action. <br><br>

4) A ship rolls +2 defense dice. <br><br>

5) A ship cannot perform any attacks beyond Range 1. NOTE: You still receive the normal +1 attack die for attacking with your Primary Weapon at Range 1. <br><br>

6) A ship may fire any Secondary Weapons that can only be fired at Range 2-3 at a ship at Range 1, but the attacking ship will sustain damage equal to the damage it inflicts minus 1. NOTE: A ship cannot take critical damage from its own attacks. <br><br>
If the Secondary Weapon requires that the attacking ship have the defending ship target locked, it may still fire that weapon, but the defending ship rolls an additional +3 defense dice. The attacking ship must discard the Secondary Weapon Upgrade when the attack is completed. <br><br>

7) A ship that overlaps another ship at the end of its movement must move backward along its chosen Maneuver Template until it no longer overlaps the other ship. This ship cannot perform any Actions this round. <br><br>

In addition, both ships must roll a number of defense dice equal to ½ of their Captain’s Skill Number (rounded up). Each ship sustains 2 damage to its Hull, minus 1 damage for every <b>[Evade]</b> result (min 0). <br><br>

If a ship is destroyed while inside the Mutara Nebula, the attacking player places 1 Mission Token beside his/her Ship Cards. <br><br>

These Mission Tokens represent the number of ships a player’s ships have destroyed for end game scoring. <br><br>

THE GAME ENDS WHEN one player is eliminated or the time limit is reached. <br><br><br>
<b><u>OBJECTIVE</u></b><br><br>
Destroy all of your opponent's ships.<br><br>

<b>Bonus:</b> At the end of the game, each player gains + 5 Fleet Points for each Mission Token beside that player’s Ship Cards (i.e. each opposing ship that was destroyed inside the Mutara Nebula). <br><br>
<b>Bonus:</b> At the end of the game, the player with the most Mission Tokens beside his/her Ship Cards gains an additional + 10 Fleet Points.
